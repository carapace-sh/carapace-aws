documentation:
  flag:
    cluster-id: |
      A unique string that identifies a cluster.
      The `create-cluster` command returns this identifier.
      You can use the `list-clusters` command to get cluster IDs.
    steps: |
      Specifies a list of steps to be executed by the cluster.
      Steps run only on the master node after applications are installed and are used to submit work to a cluster.
      A step can be specified using the shorthand syntax, by referencing a JSON file or by specifying an inline JSON structure.
      `Args` supplied with steps should be a comma-separated list of values (`Args=arg1,arg2,arg3`)
      or a bracket-enclosed list of values and key-value pairs (`Args=[arg1,arg2=value,arg4`).
