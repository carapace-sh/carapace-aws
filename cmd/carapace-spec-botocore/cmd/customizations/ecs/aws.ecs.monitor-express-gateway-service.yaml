    Monitors the progress of resource creation for an ECS Express Gateway Service.
    This command provides real-time monitoring of service deployments with interactive progress display,
    showing the status of load balancers, security groups, auto-scaling configurations,
    and other AWS resources as they are created or updated.
    Use `--resource-view RESOURCE` to view all service resources,
    or `--resource-view DEPLOYMENT` to track only resources that have changed in the most recent deployment.
    The command requires a terminal (TTY) to run and the monitoring session continues
    until manually stopped by the user or the specified timeout is reached. Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate:
    up/down to scroll through resources, ‘q’ to quit monitoring.
  flag:
    service-arn: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service to monitor.
    resource-view: |
      Specifies which resources to display during monitoring.
      RESOURCE (default) - Combines resources from all active configurations of the service
      and displays the live status of load balancers, security groups, target groups, etc.
      DEPLOYMENT - Determines the resources that are being added or removed as part of the latest service deployment,
      and displays their live statuses.
    timeout: Maximum time in minutes to monitor the service. Default is 30 minutes.
