            The `jobStatus` refers to the execution of the import job. Therefore, an import job can return a `jobStatus` as `COMPLETED` even if validation issues are discovered during the import process. If a `jobStatus` returns as `COMPLETED`, we still recommend you review the output manifests written to S3, as they provide details on the success or failure of individual P10 object imports.
