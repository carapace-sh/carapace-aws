            If you specify an existing migration task, this operation provides the default individual assessments you can specify for that task. Otherwise, the specified parameters model elements of a possible migration task on which to base a premigration assessment run.

            To use these migration task modeling parameters, you must specify an existing replication instance, a source database engine, a target database engine, and a migration type. This combination of parameters potentially limits the default individual assessments available for an assessment run created for a corresponding migration task.

            If you specify no parameters, this operation provides a list of all possible individual assessments that you can specify for an assessment run. If you specify any one of the task modeling parameters, you must specify all of them or the operation cannot provide a list of individual assessments. The only parameter that you can specify alone is for an existing migration task. The specified task definition then determines the default list of individual assessments that you can specify in an assessment run for the task.

                You can also use [ReloadTables]() to reload specific tables that failed during replication instead of restarting the replication.

                The `resume-processing` option isn't applicable for a full-load replication, because you can't resume partially loaded tables during the full load phase.

                For a `full-load-and-cdc` replication, DMS migrates table data, and then applies data changes that occur on the source. To load all the tables again, and start capturing source changes, use `reload-target`. Otherwise use `resume-processing`, to replicate the changes from the last stop position.

            endpoint-type: The type of endpoint. Valid values are `source` and `target`.
            engine-name: The database engine name. Valid values, depending on the EndpointType, include `"mysql"`, `"oracle"`, `"postgres"`, `"mariadb"`, `"aurora"`, `"aurora-postgresql"`, `"redshift"`, `"s3"`, `"db2"`, `"db2-zos"`, `"azuredb"`, `"sybase"`, `"dynamodb"`, `"mongodb"`, `"kinesis"`, `"kafka"`, `"elasticsearch"`, `"documentdb"`, `"sqlserver"`, `"neptune"`, and `"babelfish"`.
            exact-settings: |-
                If this attribute is Y, the current call to `ModifyEndpoint` replaces all existing endpoint settings with the exact settings that you specify in this call. If this attribute is N, the current call to `ModifyEndpoint` does two things:

                - It replaces any endpoint settings that already exist with new values, for settings with the same names.
                - It creates new endpoint settings that you specify in the call, for settings with different names.

                For example, if you call `create-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings '{"a":1}' ...`, the endpoint has the following endpoint settings: `'{"a":1}'`. If you then call `modify-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings '{"b":2}' ...` for the same endpoint, the endpoint has the following settings: `'{"a":1,"b":2}'`.

                However, suppose that you follow this with a call to `modify-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings '{"b":2}' --exact-settings ...` for that same endpoint again. Then the endpoint has the following settings: `'{"b":2}'`. All existing settings are replaced with the exact settings that you specify.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            kerberos-authentication-settings: Specifies the settings required for kerberos authentication when creating the replication instance.
            kms-key-id: |-
                An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the replication instance.

                If you don't specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then DMS uses your default encryption key.

                KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            multi-az: Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. You can't set the `AvailabilityZone` parameter if the Multi-AZ parameter is set to `true`.
            network-type: The type of IP address protocol used by a replication instance, such as IPv4 only or Dual-stack that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. IPv6 only is not yet supported.
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                Format: `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`

                Default: A 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time per Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of the week.

                Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

                Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
            publicly-accessible: Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance. A value of `true` represents an instance with a public IP address. A value of `false` represents an instance with a private IP address. The default value is `true`.
            replication-instance-class: |-
                The compute and memory capacity of the replication instance as defined for the specified replication instance class. For example to specify the instance class dms.c4.large, set this parameter to `"dms.c4.large"`.

                For more information on the settings and capacities for the available replication instance classes, see [Choosing the right DMS replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Types.html); and, [Selecting the best size for a replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_BestPractices.SizingReplicationInstance.html).
            replication-instance-identifier: |-
                The replication instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

                Constraints:

                - Must contain 1-63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.
                - First character must be a letter.
                - Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

                Example: `myrepinstance`
            replication-subnet-group-identifier: A subnet group to associate with the replication instance.
            resource-identifier: A friendly name for the resource identifier at the end of the `EndpointArn` response parameter that is returned in the created `Endpoint` object. The value for this parameter can have up to 31 characters. It can contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen ('-'). Also, it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens, and can only begin with a letter, such as `Example-App-ARN1`. For example, this value might result in the `EndpointArn` value `arn:aws:dms:eu-west-1:012345678901:rep:Example-App-ARN1`. If you don't specify a `ResourceIdentifier` value, DMS generates a default identifier value for the end of `EndpointArn`.
            tags: One or more tags to be assigned to the replication instance.
            vpc-security-group-ids: Specifies the VPC security group to be used with the replication instance. The VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the replication instance.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            start-replication-task-type: |-
                The type of replication task to start.

                `start-replication` is the only valid action that can be used for the first time a task with the migration type of `full-load`full-load, `full-load-and-cdc` or `cdc` is run. Any other action used for the first time on a given task, such as `resume-processing` and reload-target will result in data errors.

                You can also use [ReloadTables]() to reload specific tables that failed during migration instead of restarting the task.

                For a `full-load` task, the resume-processing option will reload any tables that were partially loaded or not yet loaded during the full load phase.

                For a `full-load-and-cdc` task, DMS migrates table data, and then applies data changes that occur on the source. To load all the tables again, and start capturing source changes, use `reload-target`. Otherwise use `resume-processing`, to replicate the changes from the last stop position.

                For a `cdc` only task, to start from a specific position, you must use start-replication and also specify the start position. Check the source endpoint DMS documentation for any limitations. For example, not all sources support starting from a time.

                `resume-processing` is only available for previously executed tasks.

            Creates an DMS event notification subscription.

            You can specify the type of source (`SourceType`) you want to be notified of, provide a list of DMS source IDs (`SourceIds`) that triggers the events, and provide a list of event categories (`EventCategories`) for events you want to be notified of. If you specify both the `SourceType` and `SourceIds`, such as `SourceType = replication-instance` and `SourceIdentifier = my-replinstance`, you will be notified of all the replication instance events for the specified source. If you specify a `SourceType` but don't specify a `SourceIdentifier`, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your DMS sources. If you don't specify either `SourceType` nor `SourceIdentifier`, you will be notified of events generated from all DMS sources belonging to your customer account.

                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
