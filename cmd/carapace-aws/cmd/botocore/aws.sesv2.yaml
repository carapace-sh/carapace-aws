            Creates the specified sending authorization policy for the given identity (an email address or a domain).

            This API is for the identity owner only. If you have not verified the identity, this API will return an error.

            Sending authorization is a feature that enables an identity owner to authorize other senders to use its identities. For information about using sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html).

            You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

            feedback-forwarding-email-address: The address that you want bounce and complaint notifications to be sent to.
            feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the `FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com, then you would specify the `FeedbackForwardingEmailAddressIdentityArn` to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the `FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress` to be feedback@example.com.

                For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html).
            from-email-address: The email address to use as the "From" address for the email. The address that you specify has to be verified.
            from-email-address-identity-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the `FromEmailAddress` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use sender@example.com, then you would specify the `FromEmailAddressIdentityArn` to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the `FromEmailAddress` to be sender@example.com.

                For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html).

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An *identity* is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity.

            When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.

            When you verify a domain without specifying the `DkimSigningAttributes` object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as [Easy DKIM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html).

            Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the `CreateEmailIdentity` operation has to include the `DkimSigningAttributes` object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.

            When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to complete the domain verification process.

            Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the email identity that you're verifying.

            Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

            Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.
