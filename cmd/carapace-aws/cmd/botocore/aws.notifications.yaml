                The matched event source.

                Must match one of the valid EventBridge sources. Only Amazon Web Services service sourced events are supported. For example, `aws.ec2` and `aws.cloudwatch`.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to be returned in this call. Defaults to 20.
            next-token: The start token for paginated calls. Retrieved from the response of a previous `ListEventRules` call. Next token uses Base64 encoding.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

        The *User Notifications API Reference* provides descriptions, API request parameters, and the JSON response for each of the User Notifications API actions.

        User Notification control plane APIs are currently available in US East (Virginia) - `us-east-1`.

        [GetNotificationEvent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/APIReference/API_GetNotificationEvent.html) and [ListNotificationEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/APIReference/API_ListNotificationEvents.html) APIs are currently available in [commercial partition Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/supported-regions.html) and only return notifications stored in the same Region in which they're called.

        The User Notifications console can only be used in US East (Virginia). Your data however, is stored in each Region chosen as a [notification hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/notification-hubs.html) in addition to US East (Virginia).

        For information about descriptions, API request parameters, and the JSON response for email contact related API actions, see the [User Notifications Contacts API Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notificationscontacts/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
