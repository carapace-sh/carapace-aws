        command: |-
            Creates a forecast for each item in the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset that was used to train the predictor. This is known as inference. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the [CreateForecastExportJob]() operation.

            The range of the forecast is determined by the `ForecastHorizon` value, which you specify in the [CreatePredictor]() request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.

            To get a list of all your forecasts, use the [ListForecasts]() operation.

            The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.

            For more information, see [howitworks-forecast]().

            The `Status` of the forecast must be `ACTIVE` before you can query or export the forecast. Use the [DescribeForecast]() operation to get the status.

            By default, a forecast includes predictions for every item (`item_id`) in the dataset group that was used to train the predictor. However, you can use the `TimeSeriesSelector` object to generate a forecast on a subset of time series. Forecast creation is skipped for any time series that you specify that are not in the input dataset. The forecast export file will not contain these time series or their forecasted values.

Accepted values include `0.01 to 0.99` (increments of .01 only) and `mean`. The mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial).

                The default quantiles are the quantiles you specified during predictor creation. If you didn't specify quantiles, the default values are `["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"]`.

                The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

        command: |-
            What-if analysis is a scenario modeling technique where you make a hypothetical change to a time series and compare the forecasts generated by these changes against the baseline, unchanged time series. It is important to remember that the purpose of a what-if analysis is to understand how a forecast can change given different modifications to the baseline time series.

            For example, imagine you are a clothing retailer who is considering an end of season sale to clear space for new styles. After creating a baseline forecast, you can use a what-if analysis to investigate how different sales tactics might affect your goals.

            You could create a scenario where everything is given a 25% markdown, and another where everything is given a fixed dollar markdown. You could create a scenario where the sale lasts for one week and another where the sale lasts for one month. With a what-if analysis, you can compare many different scenarios against each other.

            Note that a what-if analysis is meant to display what the forecasting model has learned and how it will behave in the scenarios that you are evaluating. Do not blindly use the results of the what-if analysis to make business decisions. For instance, forecasts might not be accurate for novel scenarios where there is no reference available to determine whether a forecast is good.

            The [TimeSeriesSelector]() object defines the items that you want in the what-if analysis.

            Provides metrics on the accuracy of the models that were trained by the [CreatePredictor]() operation. Use metrics to see how well the model performed and to decide whether to use the predictor to generate a forecast. For more information, see [Predictor Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/metrics.html).

            This operation generates metrics for each backtest window that was evaluated. The number of backtest windows (`NumberOfBacktestWindows`) is specified using the [EvaluationParameters]() object, which is optionally included in the `CreatePredictor` request. If `NumberOfBacktestWindows` isn't specified, the number defaults to one.

            The parameters of the `filling` method determine which items contribute to the metrics. If you want all items to contribute, specify `zero`. If you want only those items that have complete data in the range being evaluated to contribute, specify `nan`. For more information, see [FeaturizationMethod]().

            Before you can get accuracy metrics, the `Status` of the predictor must be `ACTIVE`, signifying that training has completed. To get the status, use the [DescribePredictor]() operation.

            Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor.

            Amazon Forecast creates predictors with AutoPredictor, which involves applying the optimal combination of algorithms to each time series in your datasets. You can use [CreateAutoPredictor]() to create new predictors or upgrade/retrain existing predictors.

            **Creating new predictors**

            The following parameters are required when creating a new predictor:

            - `PredictorName` - A unique name for the predictor.
            - `DatasetGroupArn` - The ARN of the dataset group used to train the predictor.
            - `ForecastFrequency` - The granularity of your forecasts (hourly, daily, weekly, etc).
            - `ForecastHorizon` - The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length.

            When creating a new predictor, do not specify a value for `ReferencePredictorArn`.

            **Upgrading and retraining predictors**

            The following parameters are required when retraining or upgrading a predictor:

            - `PredictorName` - A unique name for the predictor.
            - `ReferencePredictorArn` - The ARN of the predictor to retrain or upgrade.

            When upgrading or retraining a predictor, only specify values for the `ReferencePredictorArn` and `PredictorName`.

            explain-predictor: Create an Explainability resource for the predictor.
            forecast-dimensions: |-
                An array of dimension (field) names that specify how to group the generated forecast.

                For example, if you are generating forecasts for item sales across all your stores, and your dataset contains a `store_id` field, you would specify `store_id` as a dimension to group sales forecasts for each store.
            forecast-frequency: |-
                The frequency of predictions in a forecast.

                Valid intervals are an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D" indicates every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot specify a value that would overlap with the next larger frequency. That means, for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 minutes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour. The valid values for each frequency are the following:

                - Minute - 1-59
                - Hour - 1-23
                - Day - 1-6
                - Week - 1-4
                - Month - 1-11
                - Year - 1

                Thus, if you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or, if you want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M".

                The frequency must be greater than or equal to the TARGET\_TIME\_SERIES dataset frequency.

                When a RELATED\_TIME\_SERIES dataset is provided, the frequency must be equal to the RELATED\_TIME\_SERIES dataset frequency.
            forecast-horizon: |-
                The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length.

                The maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/4 of the TARGET\_TIME\_SERIES dataset length. If you are retraining an existing AutoPredictor, then the maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/3 of the TARGET\_TIME\_SERIES dataset length.

                If you are upgrading to an AutoPredictor or retraining an existing AutoPredictor, you cannot update the forecast horizon parameter. You can meet this requirement by providing longer time-series in the dataset.
            forecast-types: The forecast types used to train a predictor. You can specify up to five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99, by increments of 0.01 or higher. You can also specify the mean forecast with `mean`.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

                The configuration details for predictor monitoring. Provide a name for the monitor resource to enable predictor monitoring.

                Predictor monitoring allows you to see how your predictor's performance changes over time. For more information, see [Predictor Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/predictor-monitoring.html).
            optimization-metric: The accuracy metric used to optimize the predictor.
            predictor-name: A unique name for the predictor
            reference-predictor-arn: |-
                The ARN of the predictor to retrain or upgrade. This parameter is only used when retraining or upgrading a predictor. When creating a new predictor, do not specify a value for this parameter.

                When upgrading or retraining a predictor, only specify values for the `ReferencePredictorArn` and `PredictorName`. The value for `PredictorName` must be a unique predictor name.
            tags: |-
                Optional metadata to help you categorize and organize your predictors. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

                The following restrictions apply to tags:

                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique and each tag key must have one value.
                - Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.
                - Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.
                - Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of `aws:` or `AWS:`. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
            time-alignment-boundary: The time boundary Forecast uses to align and aggregate any data that doesn't align with your forecast frequency. Provide the unit of time and the time boundary as a key value pair. For more information on specifying a time boundary, see [Specifying a Time Boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/data-aggregation.html#specifying-time-boundary). If you don't provide a time boundary, Forecast uses a set of [Default Time Boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/data-aggregation.html#default-time-boundaries).

            Imports your training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that you want to import the data to.

            You must specify a [DataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_DataSource.html) object that includes an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data, as Amazon Forecast makes a copy of your data and processes it in an internal Amazon Web Services system. For more information, see [Set up permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/aws-forecast-iam-roles.html).

            The training data must be in CSV or Parquet format. The delimiter must be a comma (,).

            You can specify the path to a specific file, the S3 bucket, or to a folder in the S3 bucket. For the latter two cases, Amazon Forecast imports all files up to the limit of 10,000 files.

            Because dataset imports are not aggregated, your most recent dataset import is the one that is used when training a predictor or generating a forecast. Make sure that your most recent dataset import contains all of the data you want to model off of, and not just the new data collected since the previous import.

            To get a list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified criteria, use the [ListDatasetImportJobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_ListDatasetImportJobs.html) operation.

                - `CC_POSTALCODE` (US Only) - the country code (US), followed by the 5-digit ZIP code (Example: US\_98121).
            import-mode: Specifies whether the dataset import job is a `FULL` or `INCREMENTAL` import. A `FULL` dataset import replaces all of the existing data with the newly imported data. An `INCREMENTAL` import appends the imported data to the existing data.
            tags: |-
                The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset import job to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            time-zone: |-
                A single time zone for every item in your dataset. This option is ideal for datasets with all timestamps within a single time zone, or if all timestamps are normalized to a single time zone.

                Refer to the [Joda-Time API](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/timezones.html) for a complete list of valid time zone names.
            timestamp-format: "The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify depends on the `DataFrequency` specified when the dataset was created. The following formats are supported\n\n- \"yyyy-MM-dd\"\n  \n  For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D\n- \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\"\n  \n  For the following data frequencies: H, 30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D\n\nIf the format isn't specified, Amazon Forecast expects the format to be \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\"."

            Child resources are resources that were created from another resource. For example, when a forecast is generated from a predictor, the forecast is the child resource and the predictor is the parent resource.

            Amazon Forecast resources possess the following parent-child resource hierarchies:

            - **Dataset**: dataset import jobs
            - **Dataset Group**: predictors, predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts, forecast export jobs
            - **Predictor**: predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts, forecast export jobs
            - **Forecast**: forecast export jobs

            `DeleteResourceTree` will only delete Amazon Forecast resources, and will not delete datasets or exported files stored in Amazon S3.

            Exports an Explainability resource created by the [CreateExplainability]() operation. Exported files are exported to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

            You must specify a [DataDestination]() object that includes an Amazon S3 bucket and an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [aws-forecast-iam-roles]().

            The `Status` of the export job must be `ACTIVE` before you can access the export in your Amazon S3 bucket. To get the status, use the [DescribeExplainabilityExport]() operation.

                The following restrictions apply to tags:

                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique and each tag key must have one value.
                - Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.
                - Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.
                - Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of `aws:` or `AWS:`. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.

            Explainability is only available for Forecasts and Predictors generated from an AutoPredictor ([CreateAutoPredictor]())

            Creates an Amazon Forecast Explainability.

            Explainability helps you better understand how the attributes in your datasets impact forecast. Amazon Forecast uses a metric called Impact scores to quantify the relative impact of each attribute and determine whether they increase or decrease forecast values.

            To enable Forecast Explainability, your predictor must include at least one of the following: related time series, item metadata, or additional datasets like Holidays and the Weather Index.

            CreateExplainability accepts either a Predictor ARN or Forecast ARN. To receive aggregated Impact scores for all time series and time points in your datasets, provide a Predictor ARN. To receive Impact scores for specific time series and time points, provide a Forecast ARN.

            **CreateExplainability with a Predictor ARN**

            You can only have one Explainability resource per predictor. If you already enabled `ExplainPredictor` in [CreateAutoPredictor](), that predictor already has an Explainability resource.

            The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:

            - `ExplainabilityName` - A unique name for the Explainability.
            - `ResourceArn` - The Arn of the predictor.
            - `TimePointGranularity` - Must be set to “ALL”.
            - `TimeSeriesGranularity` - Must be set to “ALL”.

            Do not specify a value for the following parameters:

            - `DataSource` - Only valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
            - `Schema` - Only valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
            - `StartDateTime` - Only valid when TimePointGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
            - `EndDateTime` - Only valid when TimePointGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.

            **CreateExplainability with a Forecast ARN**

            You can specify a maximum of 50 time series and 500 time points.

            The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:

            - `ExplainabilityName` - A unique name for the Explainability.
            - `ResourceArn` - The Arn of the forecast.
            - `TimePointGranularity` - Either “ALL” or “SPECIFIC”.
            - `TimeSeriesGranularity` - Either “ALL” or “SPECIFIC”.

            If you set TimeSeriesGranularity to “SPECIFIC”, you must also provide the following:

            - `DataSource` - The S3 location of the CSV file specifying your time series.
            - `Schema` - The Schema defines the attributes and attribute types listed in the Data Source.

            If you set TimePointGranularity to “SPECIFIC”, you must also provide the following:

            - `StartDateTime` - The first timestamp in the range of time points.
            - `EndDateTime` - The last timestamp in the range of time points.

                - Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.
                - Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of `aws:` or `AWS:`. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.

        command: |-
            This operation creates a legacy predictor that does not include all the predictor functionalities provided by Amazon Forecast. To create a predictor that is compatible with all aspects of Forecast, use [CreateAutoPredictor]().

            Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor.

            In the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters.

            Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can then generate a forecast using the [CreateForecast]() operation.

            To see the evaluation metrics, use the [GetAccuracyMetrics]() operation.

            You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset to improve model training. For more information, see [FeaturizationConfig]().

            For RELATED\_TIME\_SERIES datasets, `CreatePredictor` verifies that the `DataFrequency` specified when the dataset was created matches the `ForecastFrequency`. TARGET\_TIME\_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see [howitworks-datasets-groups]().

            By default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the `ForecastTypes`.

            **AutoML**

            If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the `objective function`, set `PerformAutoML` to `true`. The `objective function` is defined as the mean of the weighted losses over the forecast types. By default, these are the p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see [EvaluationResult]().

            When AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed:

            - `AlgorithmArn`
            - `HPOConfig`
            - `PerformHPO`
            - `TrainingParameters`

            To get a list of all of your predictors, use the [ListPredictors]() operation.

            Before you can use the predictor to create a forecast, the `Status` of the predictor must be `ACTIVE`, signifying that training has completed. To get the status, use the [DescribePredictor]() operation.
        flag:
            algorithm-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the algorithm to use for model training. Required if `PerformAutoML` is not set to `true`.

            encryption-config: An Key Management Service (KMS) key and the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the key.
            evaluation-parameters: Used to override the default evaluation parameters of the specified algorithm. Amazon Forecast evaluates a predictor by splitting a dataset into training data and testing data. The evaluation parameters define how to perform the split and the number of iterations.
            featurization-config: The featurization configuration.
            forecast-horizon: |-
                Specifies the number of time-steps that the model is trained to predict. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length.

                For example, if you configure a dataset for daily data collection (using the `DataFrequency` parameter of the [CreateDataset]() operation) and set the forecast horizon to 10, the model returns predictions for 10 days.

                The maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/3 of the TARGET\_TIME\_SERIES dataset length.
            forecast-types: |-
                Specifies the forecast types used to train a predictor. You can specify up to five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99, by increments of 0.01 or higher. You can also specify the mean forecast with `mean`.

                The default value is `["0.10", "0.50", "0.9"]`.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            hpo-config: |-
                Provides hyperparameter override values for the algorithm. If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon Forecast uses default values. The individual algorithms specify which hyperparameters support hyperparameter optimization (HPO). For more information, see [aws-forecast-choosing-recipes]().

                If you included the `HPOConfig` object, you must set `PerformHPO` to true.
            input-data-config: Describes the dataset group that contains the data to use to train the predictor.
            optimization-metric: The accuracy metric used to optimize the predictor.
            perform-auto-ml: |-
                Whether to perform AutoML. When Amazon Forecast performs AutoML, it evaluates the algorithms it provides and chooses the best algorithm and configuration for your training dataset.

                The default value is `false`. In this case, you are required to specify an algorithm.

                Set `PerformAutoML` to `true` to have Amazon Forecast perform AutoML. This is a good option if you aren't sure which algorithm is suitable for your training data. In this case, `PerformHPO` must be false.
            perform-hpo: |-
                Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO). HPO finds optimal hyperparameter values for your training data. The process of performing HPO is known as running a hyperparameter tuning job.

                The default value is `false`. In this case, Amazon Forecast uses default hyperparameter values from the chosen algorithm.

                To override the default values, set `PerformHPO` to `true` and, optionally, supply the [HyperParameterTuningJobConfig]() object. The tuning job specifies a metric to optimize, which hyperparameters participate in tuning, and the valid range for each tunable hyperparameter. In this case, you are required to specify an algorithm and `PerformAutoML` must be false.

                The following algorithms support HPO:

                - DeepAR+
                - CNN-QR
            predictor-name: A name for the predictor.
            tags: |-
                The optional metadata that you apply to the predictor to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

The match statement consists of a key and a value.

                **Filter properties**

                - `Condition` - The condition to apply. Valid values are `IS` and `IS_NOT`. To include the forecasts that match the statement, specify `IS`. To exclude matching forecasts, specify `IS_NOT`.
                - `Key` - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are `DatasetGroupArn`, `PredictorArn`, and `Status`.
                - `Value` - The value to match.

                For example, to list all forecasts whose status is not ACTIVE, you would specify:

                `"Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS_NOT", "Key": "Status", "Value": "ACTIVE" } ]`

            Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following:

            - *`DataFrequency`* - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected.
            - *`Domain`* and *`DatasetType`* - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.
            - *`Schema`* - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.

            After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see [Importing datasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html).

            To get a list of all your datasets, use the [ListDatasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_ListDatasets.html) operation.

            For example Forecast datasets, see the [Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples).

            The `Status` of a dataset must be `ACTIVE` before you can import training data. Use the [DescribeDataset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataset.html) operation to get the status.

                The frequency of data collection. This parameter is required for RELATED\_TIME\_SERIES datasets.

                Valid intervals are an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D" indicates every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot specify a value that would overlap with the next larger frequency. That means, for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 minutes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour. The valid values for each frequency are the following:

                - Minute - 1-59
                - Hour - 1-23
                - Day - 1-6
                - Week - 1-4
                - Month - 1-11
                - Year - 1

                Thus, if you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or, if you want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M".
            dataset-name: A name for the dataset.
            dataset-type: The dataset type. Valid values depend on the chosen `Domain`.
            domain: |-

                The `Domain` and `DatasetType` that you choose determine the fields that must be present in the training data that you import to the dataset. For example, if you choose the `RETAIL` domain and `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` as the `DatasetType`, Amazon Forecast requires `item_id`, `timestamp`, and `demand` fields to be present in your data.

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

            filters: |-
                An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a match statement. The condition is either `IS` or `IS_NOT`, which specifies whether to include or exclude the what-if forecast export jobs that match the statement from the list, respectively. The match statement consists of a key and a value.

                **Filter properties**

                - `Condition` - The condition to apply. Valid values are `IS` and `IS_NOT`. To include the forecast export jobs that match the statement, specify `IS`. To exclude matching forecast export jobs, specify `IS_NOT`.
                - `Key` - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are `WhatIfForecastExportArn` and `Status`.
                - `Value` - The value to match.

                For example, to list all jobs that export a forecast named *electricityWIFExport*, specify the following filter:

                `"Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "WhatIfForecastExportArn", "Value": "arn:aws:forecast:us-west-2:<acct-id>:forecast/electricityWIFExport" } ]`

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The number of items to return in the response.
            next-token: "If the result of the previous request was truncated, the response includes a `NextToken`. To retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next\L request. Tokens expire after 24 hours."
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
