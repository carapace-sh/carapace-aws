        command: |-
            Creates a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. A monitor is built based on information from the application resources that you add: VPCs, Network Load Balancers (NLBs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon WorkSpaces directories. Internet Monitor then publishes internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the *city-networks*. That is, the locations and ASNs (typically internet service providers or ISPs), where clients access your application. For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

            When you create a monitor, you choose the percentage of traffic that you want to monitor. You can also set a maximum limit for the number of city-networks where client traffic is monitored, that caps the total traffic that Internet Monitor monitors. A city-network maximum is the limit of city-networks, but you only pay for the number of city-networks that are actually monitored. You can update your monitor at any time to change the percentage of traffic to monitor or the city-networks maximum. For more information, see [Choosing a city-network maximum value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/IMCityNetworksMaximum.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            health-events-config: |-
                Defines the threshold percentages and other configuration information for when Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor creates a health event. Internet Monitor creates a health event when an internet issue that affects your application end users has a health score percentage that is at or below a specific threshold, and, sometimes, when other criteria are met.

                If you don't set a health event threshold, the default value is 95%.

                For more information, see [Change health event thresholds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-overview.html#IMUpdateThresholdFromOverview) in the Internet Monitor section of the *CloudWatch User Guide*.
            internet-measurements-log-delivery: Publish internet measurements for Internet Monitor to an Amazon S3 bucket in addition to CloudWatch Logs.
            max-city-networks-to-monitor: |-
                The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your resources. A city-network is the location (city) where clients access your application resources from and the ASN or network provider, such as an internet service provider (ISP), that clients access the resources through. Setting this limit can help control billing costs.

                To learn more, see [Choosing a city-network maximum value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/IMCityNetworksMaximum.html) in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the *CloudWatch User Guide*.
            monitor-name: The name of the monitor.
            resources: |-
                The resources to include in a monitor, which you provide as a set of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). Resources can be VPCs, NLBs, Amazon CloudFront distributions, or Amazon WorkSpaces directories.

                You can add a combination of VPCs and CloudFront distributions, or you can add WorkSpaces directories, or you can add NLBs. You can't add NLBs or WorkSpaces directories together with any other resources.

                If you add only Amazon VPC resources, at least one VPC must have an Internet Gateway attached to it, to make sure that it has internet connectivity.
            tags: The tags for a monitor. You can add a maximum of 50 tags in Internet Monitor.
            traffic-percentage-to-monitor: |-
                The percentage of the internet-facing traffic for your application that you want to monitor with this monitor. If you set a city-networks maximum, that limit overrides the traffic percentage that you set.

                To learn more, see [Choosing an application traffic percentage to monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/IMTrafficPercentage.html) in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the *CloudWatch User Guide*.
