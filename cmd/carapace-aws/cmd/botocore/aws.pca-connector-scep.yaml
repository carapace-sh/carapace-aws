                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of objects that you want Connector for SCEP to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Connector for SCEP provides a `NextToken` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.
            next-token: When you request a list of objects with a `MaxResults` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Connector for SCEP returns a `NextToken` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            For general-purpose connectors. Creates a *challenge password* for the specified connector. The SCEP protocol uses a challenge password to authenticate a request before issuing a certificate from a certificate authority (CA). Your SCEP clients include the challenge password as part of their certificate request to Connector for SCEP. To retrieve the connector Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the connectors in your account, call [ListConnectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/C4SCEP_API/pca-connector-scep/latest/APIReference/API_ListConnectors.html).

            To create additional challenge passwords for the connector, call `CreateChallenge` again. We recommend frequently rotating your challenge passwords.

                If you don't supply a value, by default Connector for SCEP creates a connector for general-purpose use. A general-purpose connector is designed to work with clients or endpoints that support the SCEP protocol, except Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune. With connectors for general-purpose use, you manage SCEP challenge passwords using Connector for SCEP. For information about considerations and limitations with using Connector for SCEP, see [Considerations and Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlc4scep-considerations-limitations.html).

                If you provide an `IntuneConfiguration`, Connector for SCEP creates a connector for use with Microsoft Intune, and you manage the challenge passwords using Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [Using Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlconnector-for-scep-intune.html).
