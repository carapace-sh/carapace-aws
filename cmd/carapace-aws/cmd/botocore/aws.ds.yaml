            Initiates a directory assessment to validate your self-managed AD environment for hybrid domain join. The assessment checks compatibility and connectivity of the self-managed AD environment.

            A directory assessment is automatically created when you create a hybrid directory. There are two types of assessments: `CUSTOMER` and `SYSTEM`. Your Amazon Web Services account has a limit of 100 `CUSTOMER` directory assessments.

            The assessment process typically takes 30 minutes or more to complete. The assessment process is asynchronous and you can monitor it with `DescribeADAssessment`.

            The `InstanceIds` must have a one-to-one correspondence with `CustomerDnsIps`, meaning that if the IP address for instance i-10243410 is 10.24.34.100 and the IP address for instance i-10243420 is 10.24.34.200, then the input arrays must maintain the same order relationship, either \[10.24.34.100, 10.24.34.200] paired with \[i-10243410, i-10243420] or \[10.24.34.200, 10.24.34.100] paired with \[i-10243420, i-10243410].

For example, you cannot reset the password for a user in the **Amazon Web Services Reserved** OU.

With this operation you can use your directory from any Amazon Web Services account and from any Amazon VPC within an Amazon Web Services Region.

            When you share your Managed Microsoft AD directory, Directory Service creates a shared directory in the directory consumer account. This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account.

            The `ShareMethod` parameter determines whether the specified directory can be shared between Amazon Web Services accounts inside the same Amazon Web Services organization (`ORGANIZATIONS`). It also determines whether you can share the directory with any other Amazon Web Services account either inside or outside of the organization (`HANDSHAKE`).

            The `ShareNotes` parameter is only used when `HANDSHAKE` is called, which sends a directory sharing request to the directory consumer.

            Restores a directory using an existing directory snapshot.

            When you restore a directory from a snapshot, any changes made to the directory after the snapshot date are overwritten.

            This action returns as soon as the restore operation is initiated. You can monitor the progress of the restore operation by calling the [DescribeDirectories]() operation with the directory identifier. When the **DirectoryDescription.Stage** value changes to `Active`, the restore operation is complete.
