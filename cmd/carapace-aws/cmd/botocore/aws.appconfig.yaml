            deletion-protection-check: |-
                A parameter to configure deletion protection. Deletion protection prevents a user from deleting a configuration profile if your application has called either [GetLatestConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_GetLatestConfiguration.html) or for the configuration profile during the specified interval.

                This parameter supports the following values:

                - `BYPASS`: Instructs AppConfig to bypass the deletion protection check and delete a configuration profile even if deletion protection would have otherwise prevented it.
                - `APPLY`: Instructs the deletion protection check to run, even if deletion protection is disabled at the account level. `APPLY` also forces the deletion protection check to run against resources created in the past hour, which are normally excluded from deletion protection checks.
                - `ACCOUNT_DEFAULT`: The default setting, which instructs AppConfig to implement the deletion protection value specified in the `UpdateAccountSettings` API.

            deletion-protection-check: |-
                A parameter to configure deletion protection. Deletion protection prevents a user from deleting an environment if your application called either [GetLatestConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_GetLatestConfiguration.html) or in the environment during the specified interval.

                This parameter supports the following values:

                - `BYPASS`: Instructs AppConfig to bypass the deletion protection check and delete a configuration profile even if deletion protection would have otherwise prevented it.
                - `APPLY`: Instructs the deletion protection check to run, even if deletion protection is disabled at the account level. `APPLY` also forces the deletion protection check to run against resources created in the past hour, which are normally excluded from deletion protection checks.
                - `ACCOUNT_DEFAULT`: The default setting, which instructs AppConfig to implement the deletion protection value specified in the `UpdateAccountSettings` API.

            Creates an AppConfig extension. An extension augments your ability to inject logic or behavior at different points during the AppConfig workflow of creating or deploying a configuration.

            You can create your own extensions or use the Amazon Web Services authored extensions provided by AppConfig. For an AppConfig extension that uses Lambda, you must create a Lambda function to perform any computation and processing defined in the extension. If you plan to create custom versions of the Amazon Web Services authored notification extensions, you only need to specify an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the `Uri` field for the new extension version.

            - For a custom EventBridge notification extension, enter the ARN of the EventBridge default events in the `Uri` field.
            - For a custom Amazon SNS notification extension, enter the ARN of an Amazon SNS topic in the `Uri` field.
            - For a custom Amazon SQS notification extension, enter the ARN of an Amazon SQS message queue in the `Uri` field.

            For more information about extensions, see [Extending workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/working-with-appconfig-extensions.html) in the *AppConfig User Guide*.

                The configuration version returned in the most recent [GetConfiguration]() response.

                AppConfig uses the value of the `ClientConfigurationVersion` parameter to identify the configuration version on your clients. If you don’t send `ClientConfigurationVersion` with each call to [GetConfiguration](), your clients receive the current configuration. You are charged each time your clients receive a configuration.

                To avoid excess charges, we recommend you use the [StartConfigurationSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/StartConfigurationSession.html) and [GetLatestConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/GetLatestConfiguration.html) APIs, which track the client configuration version on your behalf. If you choose to continue using [GetConfiguration](), we recommend that you include the `ClientConfigurationVersion` value with every call to [GetConfiguration](). The value to use for `ClientConfigurationVersion` comes from the `ConfigurationVersion` attribute returned by [GetConfiguration]() when there is new or updated data, and should be saved for subsequent calls to [GetConfiguration]().

                For more information about working with configurations, see [Retrieving feature flags and configuration data in AppConfig](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/retrieving-feature-flags.html) in the *AppConfig User Guide*.

            Creates a configuration profile, which is information that enables AppConfig to access the configuration source. Valid configuration sources include the following:

            - Configuration data in YAML, JSON, and other formats stored in the AppConfig hosted configuration store
            - Configuration data stored as objects in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
            - Pipelines stored in CodePipeline
            - Secrets stored in Secrets Manager
            - Standard and secure string parameters stored in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store
            - Configuration data in SSM documents stored in the Systems Manager document store

            A configuration profile includes the following information:

            - The URI location of the configuration data.
            - The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that provides access to the configuration data.
            - A validator for the configuration data. Available validators include either a JSON Schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function.

                The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AppConfig supports the following growth types:

                **Linear**: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment time. For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20 initially makes the configuration available to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time has passed, the system updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets are set to receive the deployed configuration.

                **Exponential**: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: `G*(2^N)`. In this formula, `G` is the growth factor specified by the user and `N` is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:

                `2*(2^0)`

                `2*(2^1)`

                `2*(2^2)`

                Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.

                **Linear**: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for `Step percentage`. For example, a linear deployment that uses a `Step percentage` of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the hosts. After those deployments are complete, the system deploys the configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets have successfully received the configuration.

                **Exponential**: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: `G*(2^N)`. In this formula, `G` is the growth factor specified by the user and `N` is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:

                `2*(2^0)`
