            Creates an uninitialized HSM instance.

            There is an upfront fee charged for each HSM instance that you create with the `CreateHsm` operation. If you accidentally provision an HSM and want to request a refund, delete the instance using the [DeleteHsm]() operation, go to the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home), create a new case, and select **Account and Billing Support**.

            It can take up to 20 minutes to create and provision an HSM. You can monitor the status of the HSM with the [DescribeHsm]() operation. The HSM is ready to be initialized when the status changes to `RUNNING`.
