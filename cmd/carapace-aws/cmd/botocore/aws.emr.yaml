        command: Cancels a pending step or steps in a running cluster. Available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding version 5.0.0. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each CancelSteps request. CancelSteps is idempotent but asynchronous; it does not guarantee that a step will be canceled, even if the request is successfully submitted. When you use Amazon EMR releases 5.28.0 and later, you can cancel steps that are in a `PENDING` or `RUNNING` state. In earlier versions of Amazon EMR, you can only cancel steps that are in a `PENDING` state.

            `SetTerminationProtection` is used to prevent accidental termination of a cluster and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances persist so that you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance storage.

            To terminate a cluster that has been locked by setting `SetTerminationProtection` to `true`, you must first unlock the job flow by a subsequent call to `SetTerminationProtection` in which you set the value to `false`.

            For more information, see [Managing Cluster Termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/UsingEMR_TerminationProtection.html) in the *Amazon EMR Management Guide*.

            Specify whether to enable unhealthy node replacement, which lets Amazon EMR gracefully replace core nodes on a cluster if any nodes become unhealthy. For example, a node becomes unhealthy if disk usage is above 90%. If unhealthy node replacement is on and `TerminationProtected` are off, Amazon EMR immediately terminates the unhealthy core nodes. To use unhealthy node replacement and retain unhealthy core nodes, use to turn on termination protection. In such cases, Amazon EMR adds the unhealthy nodes to a denylist, reducing job interruptions and failures.

            If unhealthy node replacement is on, Amazon EMR notifies YARN and other applications on the cluster to stop scheduling tasks with these nodes, moves the data, and then terminates the nodes.

            The SetVisibleToAllUsers parameter is no longer supported. Your cluster may be visible to all users in your account. To restrict cluster access using an IAM policy, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-access-IAM.html).

            Sets the [Cluster$VisibleToAllUsers]() value for an Amazon EMR cluster. When `true`, IAM principals in the Amazon Web Services account can perform Amazon EMR cluster actions that their IAM policies allow. When `false`, only the IAM principal that created the cluster and the Amazon Web Services account root user can perform Amazon EMR actions on the cluster, regardless of IAM permissions policies attached to other IAM principals.

            This action works on running clusters. When you create a cluster, use the [RunJobFlowInput$VisibleToAllUsers]() parameter.

        command: |-
            RunJobFlow creates and starts running a new cluster (job flow). The cluster runs the steps specified. After the steps complete, the cluster stops and the HDFS partition is lost. To prevent loss of data, configure the last step of the job flow to store results in Amazon S3. If the [JobFlowInstancesConfig]() `KeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps` parameter is set to `TRUE`, the cluster transitions to the WAITING state rather than shutting down after the steps have completed.

            For additional protection, you can set the [JobFlowInstancesConfig]() `TerminationProtected` parameter to `TRUE` to lock the cluster and prevent it from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or in the event of a job flow error.

            A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow.

            If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using the SSH shell to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop.

            For long-running clusters, we recommend that you periodically store your results.

            The instance fleets configuration is available only in Amazon EMR releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. The RunJobFlow request can contain InstanceFleets parameters or InstanceGroups parameters, but not both.

                A list of strings that indicates third-party software to use with the job flow that accepts a user argument list. Amazon EMR accepts and forwards the argument list to the corresponding installation script as bootstrap action arguments. For more information, see "Launch a Job Flow on the MapR Distribution for Hadoop" in the [Amazon EMR Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-dg.pdf). Supported values are:

                - "mapr-m3" - launch the cluster using MapR M3 Edition.
                - "mapr-m5" - launch the cluster using MapR M5 Edition.
                - "mapr" with the user arguments specifying "--edition,m3" or "--edition,m5" - launch the job flow using MapR M3 or M5 Edition respectively.
                - "mapr-m7" - launch the cluster using MapR M7 Edition.
                - "hunk" - launch the cluster with the Hunk Big Data Analytics Platform.

            os-release-label: Specifies a particular Amazon Linux release for all nodes in a cluster launch RunJobFlow request. If a release is not specified, Amazon EMR uses the latest validated Amazon Linux release for cluster launch.
            placement-group-configs: The specified placement group configuration for an Amazon EMR cluster.
            release-label: The Amazon EMR release label, which determines the version of open-source application packages installed on the cluster. Release labels are in the form `emr-x.x.x`, where x.x.x is an Amazon EMR release version such as `emr-5.14.0`. For more information about Amazon EMR release versions and included application versions and features, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/). The release label applies only to Amazon EMR releases version 4.0 and later. Earlier versions use `AmiVersion`.
            repo-upgrade-on-boot: Applies only when `CustomAmiID` is used. Specifies which updates from the Amazon Linux AMI package repositories to apply automatically when the instance boots using the AMI. If omitted, the default is `SECURITY`, which indicates that only security updates are applied. If `NONE` is specified, no updates are applied, and all updates must be applied manually.
            scale-down-behavior: Specifies the way that individual Amazon EC2 instances terminate when an automatic scale-in activity occurs or an instance group is resized. `TERMINATE_AT_INSTANCE_HOUR` indicates that Amazon EMR terminates nodes at the instance-hour boundary, regardless of when the request to terminate the instance was submitted. This option is only available with Amazon EMR 5.1.0 and later and is the default for clusters created using that version. `TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION` indicates that Amazon EMR adds nodes to a deny list and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of the instance-hour boundary. With either behavior, Amazon EMR removes the least active nodes first and blocks instance termination if it could lead to HDFS corruption. `TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION` available only in Amazon EMR releases 4.1.0 and later, and is the default for releases of Amazon EMR earlier than 5.1.0.
            security-configuration: The name of a security configuration to apply to the cluster.

                The VisibleToAllUsers parameter is no longer supported. By default, the value is set to `true`. Setting it to `false` now has no effect.

                Set this value to `true` so that IAM principals in the Amazon Web Services account associated with the cluster can perform Amazon EMR actions on the cluster that their IAM policies allow. This value defaults to `true` for clusters created using the Amazon EMR API or the CLI [create-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html) command.

                When set to `false`, only the IAM principal that created the cluster and the Amazon Web Services account root user can perform Amazon EMR actions for the cluster, regardless of the IAM permissions policies attached to other IAM principals.

            AddJobFlowSteps adds new steps to a running cluster. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow.

            If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using SSH to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop.

            A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the master node of the cluster or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by the main function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class can be specified either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the MainFunction parameter of the step.

            Amazon EMR executes each step in the order listed. For a step to be considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero exit code and all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must have completed and run successfully.

            You can only add steps to a cluster that is in one of the following states: STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.

            The string values passed into `HadoopJarStep` object cannot exceed a total of 10240 characters.

                A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access. The configuration applies to all clusters created in your account for the current Region. The configuration specifies whether block public access is enabled. If block public access is enabled, security groups associated with the cluster cannot have rules that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an exception using `PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges` in the `BlockPublicAccessConfiguration`. By default, Port 22 (SSH) is an exception, and public access is allowed on this port. You can change this by updating `BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules` to remove the exception.

                For accounts that created clusters in a Region before November 25, 2019, block public access is disabled by default in that Region. To use this feature, you must manually enable and configure it. For accounts that did not create an Amazon EMR cluster in a Region before this date, block public access is enabled by default in that Region.
