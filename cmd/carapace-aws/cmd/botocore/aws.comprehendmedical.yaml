            The `DetectEntitiesV2` operation replaces the [DetectEntities]() operation. This new action uses a different model for determining the entities in your medical text and changes the way that some entities are returned in the output. You should use the `DetectEntitiesV2` operation in all new applications.

            The `DetectEntitiesV2` operation returns the `Acuity` and `Direction` entities as attributes instead of types.
