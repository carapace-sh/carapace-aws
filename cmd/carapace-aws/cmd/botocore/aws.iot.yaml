            The certificate being transferred must not be in the `ACTIVE` state. You can use the [UpdateCertificate]() action to deactivate it.

            The certificate must not have any policies attached to it. You can use the [DetachPolicy]() action to detach them.

            **Customer managed key behavior:** When you use a customer managed key to secure your data and then transfer the key to a customer in a different account using the [TransferCertificate]() operation, the certificates will no longer be protected by their customer managed key configuration. During the transfer process, certificates are encrypted using IoT owned keys.

            While a certificate is in the **PENDING\_TRANSFER** state, it's always protected by IoT owned keys, regardless of the customer managed key configuration of either the source or destination account.

            Once the transfer is completed through [AcceptCertificateTransfer](), [RejectCertificateTransfer](), or [CancelCertificateTransfer](), the certificate will be protected by the customer managed key configuration of the account that owns the certificate after the transfer operation:

            - If the transfer is accepted: The certificate is protected by the destination account's customer managed key configuration.

                The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

                `$aws/things/THING_NAME/jobs/JOB_ID/notify-namespace-NAMESPACE_ID/`

                The `namespaceId` feature is only supported by IoT Greengrass at this time. For more information, see [Setting up IoT Greengrass core devices.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html)

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            status: An optional filter that lets you search for jobs that have the specified status.
            target-selection: |-
                Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

                We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot jobs for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs, devices that join the group receive the job execution even after the job has been created.
            thing-group-id: A filter that limits the returned jobs to those for the specified group.
            thing-group-name: A filter that limits the returned jobs to those for the specified group.

            Creates an X.509 certificate using the specified certificate signing request.

            Requires permission to access the [CreateCertificateFromCsr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action.

            The CSR must include a public key that is either an RSA key with a length of at least 2048 bits or an ECC key from NIST P-256, NIST P-384, or NIST P-521 curves. For supported certificates, consult [Certificate signing algorithms supported by IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-client-certs.html#x509-cert-algorithms).

            Reusing the same certificate signing request (CSR) results in a distinct certificate.

            You can create multiple certificates in a batch by creating a directory, copying multiple `.csr` files into that directory, and then specifying that directory on the command line. The following commands show how to create a batch of certificates given a batch of CSRs. In the following commands, we assume that a set of CSRs are located inside of the directory my-csr-directory:

            On Linux and OS X, the command is:

            `$ ls my-csr-directory/ | xargs -I {} aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/{}`

            This command lists all of the CSRs in my-csr-directory and pipes each CSR file name to the `aws iot create-certificate-from-csr` Amazon Web Services CLI command to create a certificate for the corresponding CSR.

            You can also run the `aws iot create-certificate-from-csr` part of the command in parallel to speed up the certificate creation process:

            `$ ls my-csr-directory/ | xargs -P 10 -I {} aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/{}`

            On Windows PowerShell, the command to create certificates for all CSRs in my-csr-directory is:

            `> ls -Name my-csr-directory | %{aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/$_}`

            On a Windows command prompt, the command to create certificates for all CSRs in my-csr-directory is:

            `> forfiles /p my-csr-directory /c "cmd /c aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://@path"`
        flag:
            certificate-signing-request: The certificate signing request (CSR).

The default percentile groupings are: 1,5,25,50,75,95,99, although you can specify your own when you call `GetPercentiles`. This function returns a value for each percentile group specified (or the default percentile groupings).

                `documentParameters` can only be used when creating jobs from Amazon Web Services managed templates. This parameter can't be used with custom job templates or to create jobs from them.
            document-source: |-
                An S3 link, or S3 object URL, to the job document. The link is an Amazon S3 object URL and is required if you don't specify a value for `document`.

                For example, `--document-source https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/example-firmware/device-firmware.1.0`

                For more information, see [Methods for accessing a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-bucket-intro.html).
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            job-executions-retry-config: Allows you to create the criteria to retry a job.
            job-executions-rollout-config: Allows you to create a staged rollout of the job.
            job-id: A job identifier which must be unique for your account. We recommend using a UUID. Alpha-numeric characters, "-" and "\_" are valid for use here.
            job-template-arn: The ARN of the job template used to create the job.
            namespace-id: |-
                The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

                When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value in the following format.

                `$aws/things/THING_NAME/jobs/JOB_ID/notify-namespace-NAMESPACE_ID/`

                The `namespaceId` feature is only supported by IoT Greengrass at this time. For more information, see [Setting up IoT Greengrass core devices.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html)
            presigned-url-config: Configuration information for pre-signed S3 URLs.
            scheduling-config: The configuration that allows you to schedule a job for a future date and time in addition to specifying the end behavior for each job execution.
            tags: Metadata which can be used to manage the job.
            target-selection: |-
                Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

                We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot jobs for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs, devices that join the group receive the job execution even after the job has been created.
            targets: A list of things and thing groups to which the job should be sent.
            timeout-config: Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution of the job. The timer is started when the job execution status is set to `IN_PROGRESS`. If the job execution status is not set to another terminal state before the time expires, it will be automatically set to `TIMED_OUT`.

        IoT

        IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate devices.

        The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in [Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html). You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access.

        The service name used by [Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to sign the request is: *execute-api*.

        For more information about how IoT works, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html).

        For information about how to use the credentials provider for IoT, see [Authorizing Direct Calls to Amazon Web Services Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html).
