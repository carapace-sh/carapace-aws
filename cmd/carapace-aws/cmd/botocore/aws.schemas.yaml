                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
