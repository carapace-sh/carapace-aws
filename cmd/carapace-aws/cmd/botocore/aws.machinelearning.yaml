            Creates a `DataSource` object from an [Amazon Relational Database Service](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (Amazon RDS). A `DataSource` references data that can be used to perform `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

            `CreateDataSourceFromRDS` is an asynchronous operation. In response to `CreateDataSourceFromRDS`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the `DataSource` status to `PENDING`. After the `DataSource` is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the `Status` parameter to `COMPLETED`. `DataSource` in the `COMPLETED` or `PENDING` state can be used only to perform `>CreateMLModel`&gt;, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

            If Amazon ML cannot accept the input source, it sets the `Status` parameter to `FAILED` and includes an error message in the `Message` attribute of the `GetDataSource` operation response.

            Creates a `DataSource` object. A `DataSource` references data that can be used to perform `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

            `CreateDataSourceFromS3` is an asynchronous operation. In response to `CreateDataSourceFromS3`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the `DataSource` status to `PENDING`. After the `DataSource` has been created and is ready for use, Amazon ML sets the `Status` parameter to `COMPLETED`. `DataSource` in the `COMPLETED` or `PENDING` state can be used to perform only `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation` or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

            If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the `Status` parameter to `FAILED` and includes an error message in the `Message` attribute of the `GetDataSource` operation response.

            The observation data used in a `DataSource` should be ready to use; that is, it should have a consistent structure, and missing data values should be kept to a minimum. The observation data must reside in one or more .csv files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location, along with a schema that describes the data items by name and type. The same schema must be used for all of the data files referenced by the `DataSource`.

            After the `DataSource` has been created, it's ready to use in evaluations and batch predictions. If you plan to use the `DataSource` to train an `MLModel`, the `DataSource` also needs a recipe. A recipe describes how each input variable will be used in training an `MLModel`. Will the variable be included or excluded from training? Will the variable be manipulated; for example, will it be combined with another variable or will it be split apart into word combinations? The recipe provides answers to these questions.

            Creates a `DataSource` from a database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster. A `DataSource` references data that can be used to perform either `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

            `CreateDataSourceFromRedshift` is an asynchronous operation. In response to `CreateDataSourceFromRedshift`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the `DataSource` status to `PENDING`. After the `DataSource` is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the `Status` parameter to `COMPLETED`. `DataSource` in `COMPLETED` or `PENDING` states can be used to perform only `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

            If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the `Status` parameter to `FAILED` and includes an error message in the `Message` attribute of the `GetDataSource` operation response.

            The observations should be contained in the database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster and should be specified by a `SelectSqlQuery` query. Amazon ML executes an `Unload` command in Amazon Redshift to transfer the result set of the `SelectSqlQuery` query to `S3StagingLocation`.

            After the `DataSource` has been created, it's ready for use in evaluations and batch predictions. If you plan to use the `DataSource` to train an `MLModel`, the `DataSource` also requires a recipe. A recipe describes how each input variable will be used in training an `MLModel`. Will the variable be included or excluded from training? Will the variable be manipulated; for example, will it be combined with another variable or will it be split apart into word combinations? The recipe provides answers to these questions.

            You can't change an existing datasource, but you can copy and modify the settings from an existing Amazon Redshift datasource to create a new datasource. To do so, call `GetDataSource` for an existing datasource and copy the values to a `CreateDataSource` call. Change the settings that you want to change and make sure that all required fields have the appropriate values.

        command: |-
            Creates a new `Evaluation` of an `MLModel`. An `MLModel` is evaluated on a set of observations associated to a `DataSource`. Like a `DataSource` for an `MLModel`, the `DataSource` for an `Evaluation` contains values for the `Target Variable`. The `Evaluation` compares the predicted result for each observation to the actual outcome and provides a summary so that you know how effective the `MLModel` functions on the test data. Evaluation generates a relevant performance metric, such as BinaryAUC, RegressionRMSE or MulticlassAvgFScore based on the corresponding `MLModelType`: `BINARY`, `REGRESSION` or `MULTICLASS`.

            `CreateEvaluation` is an asynchronous operation. In response to `CreateEvaluation`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the evaluation status to `PENDING`. After the `Evaluation` is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the status to `COMPLETED`.

            You can use the `GetEvaluation` operation to check progress of the evaluation during the creation operation.

                next-token: The ID of the page in the paginated results.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                prefix: |-
                    A string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as `Name` or `Id`.

                    For example, a `DataSource` could have the `Name` `2014-09-09-HolidayGiftMailer`. To search for this `DataSource`, select `Name` for the `FilterVariable` and any of the following strings for the `Prefix`:

                    - 2014-09
                    - 2014-09-09
                    - 2014-09-09-Holiday
                sort-order: |-
                    A two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the resulting list of `DataSource`.

                    - `asc` - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).
                    - `dsc` - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

                    Results are sorted by `FilterVariable`.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
