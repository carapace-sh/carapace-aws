            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of volume results returned by `DescribeExportTasks` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeExportTasks` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element.
            next-token: The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `DescribeExportTasks` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Exports might provide an estimate of fees and savings based on certain information that you provide. Fee estimates do not include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees and savings depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of Amazon Web Services services, which might vary from the estimates provided in this report.

            If you do not specify `preferences` or `agentIds` in the filter, a summary of all servers, applications, tags, and performance is generated. This data is an aggregation of all server data collected through on-premises tooling, file import, application grouping and applying tags.

            If you specify `agentIds` in a filter, the task exports up to 72 hours of detailed data collected by the identified Application Discovery Agent, including network, process, and performance details. A time range for exported agent data may be set by using `startTime` and `endTime`. Export of detailed agent data is limited to five concurrently running exports. Export of detailed agent data is limited to two exports per day.

            If you enable `ec2RecommendationsPreferences` in `preferences` , an Amazon EC2 instance matching the characteristics of each server in Application Discovery Service is generated. Changing the attributes of the `ec2RecommendationsPreferences` changes the criteria of the recommendation.

            Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services Migration Hub without having to use the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application Discovery Service) tools such as the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector or Application Discovery Agent. This gives you the option to perform migration assessment and planning directly from your imported data, including the ability to group your devices as applications and track their migration status.

            To start an import request, do this:

            1. Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import template, which you can find here: [https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import\_template.csv](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv).
            2. Fill out the template with your server and application data.
            3. Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note of it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.
            4. Use the console or the `StartImportTask` command with the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to import the records from your file.

            For more information, including step-by-step procedures, see [Migration Hub Import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-import.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide*.

            There are limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and delete) in an Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/ads_service_limits.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide*.
