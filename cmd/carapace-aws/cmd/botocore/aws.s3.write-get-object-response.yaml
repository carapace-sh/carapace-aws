    --error-code=: A string that uniquely identifies an error condition.
    --error-message=: Contains a generic description of the error condition.
    --etag=: An opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.
    --expiration=: If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header.
    --expires=: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
    --last-modified=: The date and time that the object was last modified.
    --metadata=: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
    --missing-meta=: Set to the number of metadata entries not returned in `x-amz-meta` headers.
    --object-lock-legal-hold-status=: Indicates whether an object stored in Amazon S3 has an active legal hold.

    --object-lock-retain-until-date=: The date and time when Object Lock is configured to expire.
    --parts-count=: The count of parts this object has.
    --replication-status=: Indicates if request involves bucket that is either a source or destination in a Replication rule.
    --request-charged=: ""
    --request-route=!: Route prefix to the HTTP URL generated.
    --request-token=!: A single use encrypted token that maps `WriteGetObjectResponse` to the end user `GetObject` request.
    --restore=: Provides information about object restoration operation and expiration time of the restored object copy.
    --server-side-encryption=: The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing requested object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.
    --ssecustomer-algorithm=: Encryption algorithm used if server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was specified for object stored in Amazon S3.
    --ssecustomer-key-md5=: 128-bit MD5 digest of customer-provided encryption key used in Amazon S3 to encrypt data stored in S3.
    --ssekmskey-id=: If present, specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetric encryption customer managed key that was used for stored in Amazon S3 object.
