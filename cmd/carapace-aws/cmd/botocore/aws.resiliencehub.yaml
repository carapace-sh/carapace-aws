            Creates a resiliency policy for an application.

            Resilience Hub allows you to provide a value of zero for `rtoInSecs` and `rpoInSecs` of your resiliency policy. But, while assessing your application, the lowest possible assessment result is near zero. Hence, if you provide value zero for `rtoInSecs` and `rpoInSecs`, the estimated workload RTO and estimated workload RPO result will be near zero and the **Compliance status** for your application will be set to **Policy breached**.

            Creates an Resilience Hub application. An Resilience Hub application is a collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to prevent and recover Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To describe a Resilience Hub application, you provide an application name, resources from one or more CloudFormation stacks, Resource Groups, Terraform state files, AppRegistry applications, and an appropriate resiliency policy. In addition, you can also add resources that are located on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters as optional resources. For more information about the number of resources supported per application, see [Service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/resiliencehub.html#limits_resiliencehub).

            After you create an Resilience Hub application, you publish it so that you can run a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use recommendations from the assessment to improve resiliency by running another assessment, comparing results, and then iterating the process until you achieve your goals for recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).

documentation:
    command: Resilience Hub helps you proactively prepare and protect your Amazon Web Services applications from disruptions. It offers continual resiliency assessment and validation that integrates into your software development lifecycle. This enables you to uncover resiliency weaknesses, ensure recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) targets for your applications are met, and resolve issues before they are released into production.
