      documentation:
        command: |-
            The PutAttributes operation creates or replaces attributes in an item. The client may specify new attributes using a combination of the `Attribute.X.Name` and `Attribute.X.Value` parameters. The client specifies the first attribute by the parameters `Attribute.0.Name` and `Attribute.0.Value`, the second attribute by the parameters `Attribute.1.Name` and `Attribute.1.Value`, and so on.

            Attributes are uniquely identified in an item by their name/value combination. For example, a single item can have the attributes `{ "first_name", "first_value" }` and `{ "first_name", second_value" }`. However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both the `Attribute.X.Name` and `Attribute.X.Value` are the same.

            Optionally, the requestor can supply the `Replace` parameter for each individual attribute. Setting this value to `true` causes the new attribute value to replace the existing attribute value(s). For example, if an item has the attributes `{ 'a', '1' }`, `{ 'b', '2'}` and `{ 'b', '3' }` and the requestor calls `PutAttributes` using the attributes `{ 'b', '4' }` with the `Replace` parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item are changed to `{ 'a', '1' }` and `{ 'b', '4' }`, which replaces the previous values of the 'b' attribute with the new value.

            You cannot specify an empty string as an attribute name.

            Because Amazon SimpleDB makes multiple copies of client data and uses an eventual consistency update model, an immediate [GetAttributes]() or [Select]() operation (read) immediately after a [PutAttributes]() or [DeleteAttributes]() operation (write) might not return the updated data.

            The following limitations are enforced for this operation:

            - 256 total attribute name-value pairs per item
            - One billion attributes per domain
            - 10 GB of total user data storage per domain

            The `Select` operation returns a set of attributes for `ItemNames` that match the select expression. `Select` is similar to the standard SQL SELECT statement.

            The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total size. Amazon SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items returned per page to enforce this limit. For example, if the client asks to retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate `NextToken` so the client can access the next page of results.

            The `BatchPutAttributes` operation creates or replaces attributes within one or more items. By using this operation, the client can perform multiple [PutAttribute]() operation with a single call. This helps yield savings in round trips and latencies, enabling Amazon SimpleDB to optimize requests and generally produce better throughput.

            The client may specify the item name with the `Item.X.ItemName` parameter. The client may specify new attributes using a combination of the `Item.X.Attribute.Y.Name` and `Item.X.Attribute.Y.Value` parameters. The client may specify the first attribute for the first item using the parameters `Item.0.Attribute.0.Name` and `Item.0.Attribute.0.Value`, and for the second attribute for the first item by the parameters `Item.0.Attribute.1.Name` and `Item.0.Attribute.1.Value`, and so on.

            Attributes are uniquely identified within an item by their name/value combination. For example, a single item can have the attributes `{ "first_name", "first_value" }` and `{ "first_name", "second_value" }`. However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both the `Item.X.Attribute.Y.Name` and `Item.X.Attribute.Y.Value` are the same.

            Optionally, the requester can supply the `Replace` parameter for each individual value. Setting this value to `true` will cause the new attribute values to replace the existing attribute values. For example, if an item `I` has the attributes `{ 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'}` and `{ 'b', '3' }` and the requester does a BatchPutAttributes of `{'I', 'b', '4' }` with the Replace parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item will be `{ 'a', '1' }` and `{ 'b', '4' }`, replacing the previous values of the 'b' attribute with the new value.

            This operation is vulnerable to exceeding the maximum URL size when making a REST request using the HTTP GET method. This operation does not support conditions using `Expected.X.Name`, `Expected.X.Value`, or `Expected.X.Exists`.

            You can execute multiple `BatchPutAttributes` operations and other operations in parallel. However, large numbers of concurrent `BatchPutAttributes` calls can result in Service Unavailable (503) responses.

            The following limitations are enforced for this operation:

            - 256 attribute name-value pairs per item
            - 1 MB request size
            - 1 billion attributes per domain
            - 10 GB of total user data storage per domain
            - 25 item limit per `BatchPutAttributes` operation
