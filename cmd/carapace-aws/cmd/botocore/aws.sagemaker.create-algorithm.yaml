flags:
    --algorithm-description=: A description of the algorithm.
    --algorithm-name=!: The name of the algorithm.
    --certify-for-marketplace=: Whether to certify the algorithm so that it can be listed in Amazon Web Services Marketplace.
    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request
    --inference-specification=: 'Specifies details about inference jobs that the algorithm runs, including the following:'
    --tags=: An array of key-value pairs.
    --training-specification=!: 'Specifies details about training jobs run by this algorithm, including the following:'
    --validation-specification=: Specifies configurations for one or more training jobs and that SageMaker runs to test the algorithm's training code and, optionally, one or more batch transform jobs that SageMaker runs to test the algorithm's inference code.
