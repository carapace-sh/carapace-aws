                For security group policies, the cleanup does the following for each security group in the policy:

                - Disassociates the security group from in-scope resources
                - Deletes the security group if it was created through Firewall Manager and if it's no longer associated with any resources through another policy

                For security group common policies, even if set to `False`, Firewall Manager deletes all security groups created by Firewall Manager that aren't associated with any other resources through another policy.

                After the cleanup, in-scope resources are no longer protected by web ACLs in this policy. Protection of out-of-scope resources remains unchanged. Scope is determined by tags that you create and accounts that you associate with the policy. When creating the policy, if you specify that only resources in specific accounts or with specific tags are in scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are handled by the policy. All others are out of scope. If you don't specify tags or accounts, all resources are in scope.

        command: Creates or updates an Firewall Manager administrator account. The account must be a member of the organization that was onboarded to Firewall Manager by [AssociateAdminAccount](). Only the organization's management account can create an Firewall Manager administrator account. When you create an Firewall Manager administrator account, the service checks to see if the account is already a delegated administrator within Organizations. If the account isn't a delegated administrator, Firewall Manager calls Organizations to delegate the account within Organizations. For more information about administrator accounts within Organizations, see [Managing the Amazon Web Services Accounts in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts.html).
        flag:
            admin-account: The Amazon Web Services account ID to add as an Firewall Manager administrator account.

            admin-scope: Configures the resources that the specified Firewall Manager administrator can manage. As a best practice, set the administrative scope according to the principles of least privilege. Only grant the administrator the specific resources or permissions that they need to perform the duties of their role.
