            Creates a response headers policy.

            A response headers policy contains information about a set of HTTP headers. To create a response headers policy, you provide some metadata about the policy and a set of configurations that specify the headers.

            After you create a response headers policy, you can use its ID to attach it to one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the response headers policy affects the HTTP headers that CloudFront includes in HTTP responses to requests that match the cache behavior. CloudFront adds or removes response headers according to the configuration of the response headers policy.

            For more information, see [Adding or removing HTTP headers in CloudFront responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/modifying-response-headers.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            The `ListConflictingAliases` API operation only supports standard distributions. To list domain conflicts for both standard distributions and distribution tenants, we recommend that you use the [ListDomainConflicts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomainConflicts.html) API operation instead.

            Gets a list of aliases that conflict or overlap with the provided alias, and the associated CloudFront standard distribution and Amazon Web Services accounts for each conflicting alias. An alias is commonly known as a custom domain or vanity domain. It can also be called a CNAME or alternate domain name.

            In the returned list, the standard distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the standard distribution and accounts that you own, and helps to protect the information of ones that you don't own.

            Use this operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide `www.example.com` as input, the returned list can include `www.example.com` and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (`.example.com`*), if they exist. If you provide* `.example.com` as input, the returned list can include `*.example.com` and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, `www.example.com`, `test.example.com`, `dev.example.com`, and so on), if they exist.

            To list conflicting aliases, specify the alias to search and the ID of a standard distribution in your account that has an attached TLS certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to set up the standard distribution and certificate, see [Moving an alternate domain name to a different standard distribution or distribution tenant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the `NextMarker` value from the current response as the `Marker` value in the subsequent request.

            We recommend that you use the `ListDomainConflicts` API operation to check for domain conflicts, as it supports both standard distributions and distribution tenants. [ListConflictingAliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_ListConflictingAliases.html) performs similar checks but only supports standard distributions.

            Lists existing domain associations that conflict with the domain that you specify.

            You can use this API operation to identify potential domain conflicts when moving domains between standard distributions and/or distribution tenants. Domain conflicts must be resolved first before they can be moved.

            For example, if you provide `www.example.com` as input, the returned list can include `www.example.com` and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (`.example.com`*), if they exist. If you provide* `.example.com` as input, the returned list can include `*.example.com` and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, `www.example.com`, `test.example.com`, `dev.example.com`, and so on), if they exist.

            To list conflicting domains, specify the following:

            - The domain to search for
            - The ID of a standard distribution or distribution tenant in your account that has an attached TLS certificate, which covers the specified domain

            For more information, including how to set up the standard distribution or distribution tenant, and the certificate, see [Moving an alternate domain name to a different standard distribution or distribution tenant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the `NextMarker` value from the current response as the `Marker` value in the subsequent request.

            Creates an origin request policy.

            After you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront sends to the origin includes the following:

            - The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the viewer request.
            - The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including `Host`, `User-Agent`, and `X-Amz-Cf-Id`.
            - All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional ones that are added by CloudFront.

            CloudFront sends a request when it can't find a valid object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use `CachePolicy`.

            For more information about origin request policies, see [Controlling origin requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            Moves a domain from its current standard distribution or distribution tenant to another one.

            You must first disable the source distribution (standard distribution or distribution tenant) and then separately call this operation to move the domain to another target distribution (standard distribution or distribution tenant).

            To use this operation, specify the domain and the ID of the target resource (standard distribution or distribution tenant). For more information, including how to set up the target resource, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see [Moving an alternate domain name to a different standard distribution or distribution tenant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            Delete a streaming distribution. To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API, perform the following steps.

            **To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API**:

            1. Disable the RTMP distribution.
            2. Submit a `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request to get the current configuration and the `Etag` header for the distribution.
            3. Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request to change the value of `Enabled` to `false`.
            4. Submit a `PUT Streaming Distribution Config` request to update the configuration for your distribution. In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 3. Then set the value of the HTTP `If-Match` header to the value of the `ETag` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request in Step 2.
            5. Review the response to the `PUT Streaming Distribution Config` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully disabled.
            6. Submit a `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of `Status` is `Deployed`.
            7. Submit a `DELETE Streaming Distribution` request. Set the value of the HTTP `If-Match` header to the value of the `ETag` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request in Step 2.
            8. Review the response to your `DELETE Streaming Distribution` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully deleted.

            For information about deleting a distribution using the CloudFront console, see [Deleting a Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowToDeleteDistribution.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

The primary distribution retains its `Aliases` (also known as alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and `ContinuousDeploymentPolicyId` value, but otherwise its configuration is overwritten to match the staging distribution.

            You can use this operation in a continuous deployment workflow after you have tested configuration changes on the staging distribution. After using a continuous deployment policy to move a portion of your domain name's traffic to the staging distribution and verifying that it works as intended, you can use this operation to copy the staging distribution's configuration to the primary distribution. This action will disable the continuous deployment policy and move your domain's traffic back to the primary distribution.

            To create a key group, you must specify at least one public key for the key group. After you create a key group, you can reference it from one or more cache behaviors. When you reference a key group in a cache behavior, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior.

            To test a function, you provide an *event object* that represents an HTTP request or response that your CloudFront distribution could receive in production. CloudFront runs the function, passing it the event object that you provided, and returns the function's result (the modified event object) in the response. The response also contains function logs and error messages, if any exist. For more information about testing functions, see [Testing functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/managing-functions.html#test-function) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            To test a function, you provide the function's name and version (`ETag` value) along with the event object. To get the function's name and version, you can use `ListFunctions` and `DescribeFunction`.

            The `AssociateAlias` API operation only supports standard distributions. To move domains between distribution tenants and/or standard distributions, we recommend that you use the [UpdateDomainAssociation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDomainAssociation.html) API operation instead.

            Associates an alias with a CloudFront standard distribution. An alias is commonly known as a custom domain or vanity domain. It can also be called a CNAME or alternate domain name.

            With this operation, you can move an alias that's already used for a standard distribution to a different standard distribution. This prevents the downtime that could occur if you first remove the alias from one standard distribution and then separately add the alias to another standard distribution.

            To use this operation, specify the alias and the ID of the target standard distribution.

            For more information, including how to set up the target standard distribution, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see [Moving an alternate domain name to a different standard distribution or distribution tenant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            marker: Use this parameter when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of invalidation batches. Because the results are returned in decreasing order from most recent to oldest, the most recent results are on the first page, the second page will contain earlier results, and so on. To get the next page of results, set `Marker` to the value of the `NextMarker` from the current page's response. This value is the same as the ID of the last invalidation batch on that page.
            max-items: The maximum number of invalidation batches that you want in the response body.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            To use a continuous deployment policy, first use `CopyDistribution` to create a staging distribution, then use `UpdateDistribution` to modify the staging distribution's configuration.

            After you create and update a staging distribution, you can use a continuous deployment policy to incrementally move traffic to the staging distribution. This workflow enables you to test changes to a distribution's configuration before moving all of your domain's production traffic to the new configuration.
