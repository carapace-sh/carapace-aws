            Retrieves a list of traces for a given `RetrievalToken` from the CloudWatch log group generated by Transaction Search. For information on what each trace returns, see [BatchGetTraces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_BatchGetTraces.html).

            This API does not initiate a retrieval process. To start a trace retrieval, use `StartTraceRetrieval`, which generates the required `RetrievalToken`.

            When the `RetrievalStatus` is not *COMPLETE*, the API will return an empty response. Retry the request once the retrieval has completed to access the full list of traces.

            For cross-account observability, this API can retrieve traces from linked accounts when CloudWatch log is set as the destination across relevant accounts. For more details, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html).

            For retrieving data from X-Ray directly as opposed to the Transaction Search generated log group, see [BatchGetTraces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_BatchGetTraces.html).

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. A segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments.

            Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment document schema, see [Amazon Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray-interface-api.html#xray-api-segmentdocuments.html) in the *Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide*.

            **Required segment document fields**

            - `name` - The name of the service that handled the request.
            - `id` - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.
            - `trace_id` - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request.
            - `start_time` - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example, `1480615200.010` or `1.480615200010E9`.
            - `end_time` - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example, `1480615200.090` or `1.480615200090E9`. Specify either an `end_time` or `in_progress`.
            - `in_progress` - Set to `true` instead of specifying an `end_time` to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to trace that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.

            A `trace_id` consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. For trace IDs created by an X-Ray SDK, or by Amazon Web Services services integrated with X-Ray, a trace ID includes:

            **Trace ID Format**

            - The version number, for instance, `1`.
            - The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8 hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time is `1480615200` seconds, or `58406520` in hexadecimal.
            - A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits.

            Trace IDs created via OpenTelemetry have a different format based on the [W3C Trace Context specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/). A W3C trace ID must be formatted in the X-Ray trace ID format when sending to X-Ray. For example, a W3C trace ID `4efaaf4d1e8720b39541901950019ee5` should be formatted as `1-4efaaf4d-1e8720b39541901950019ee5` when sending to X-Ray. While X-Ray trace IDs include the original request timestamp in Unix epoch time, this is not required or validated.

            The response is empty until the `RetrievalStatus` is *COMPLETE*. Retry the request after the status changes from *RUNNING* or *SCHEDULED* to *COMPLETE* to access the full service graph.

            When CloudWatch log is the destination, this API can support cross-account observability and service graph retrieval across linked accounts.
