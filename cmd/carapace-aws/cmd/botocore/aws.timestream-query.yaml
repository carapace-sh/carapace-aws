            DescribeEndpoints returns a list of available endpoints to make Timestream API calls against. This API is available through both Write and Query.

            Because the Timestream SDKs are designed to transparently work with the service’s architecture, including the management and mapping of the service endpoints, *it is not recommended that you use this API unless*:

            - You are using [VPC endpoints (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink) with Timestream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/VPCEndpoints)
            - Your application uses a programming language that does not yet have SDK support
            - You require better control over the client-side implementation

            For detailed information on how and when to use and implement DescribeEndpoints, see [The Endpoint Discovery Pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/Using.API.html#Using-API.endpoint-discovery).

                Unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters specified when a `Query` request is made. Providing a `ClientToken` makes the call to `Query` *idempotent*. This means that running the same query repeatedly will produce the same result. In other words, making multiple identical `Query` requests has the same effect as making a single request. When using `ClientToken` in a query, note the following:

                - If the Query API is instantiated without a `ClientToken`, the Query SDK generates a `ClientToken` on your behalf.
                - If the `Query` invocation only contains the `ClientToken` but does not include a `NextToken`, that invocation of `Query` is assumed to be a new query run.
                - If the invocation contains `NextToken`, that particular invocation is assumed to be a subsequent invocation of a prior call to the Query API, and a result set is returned.
                - After 4 hours, any request with the same `ClientToken` is treated as a new request.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-rows: |-
                The total number of rows to be returned in the `Query` output. The initial run of `Query` with a `MaxRows` value specified will return the result set of the query in two cases:

                - The size of the result is less than `1MB`.
                - The number of rows in the result set is less than the value of `maxRows`.

                Otherwise, the initial invocation of `Query` only returns a `NextToken`, which can then be used in subsequent calls to fetch the result set. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value in the subsequent command.

                If the row size is large (e.g. a row has many columns), Timestream may return fewer rows to keep the response size from exceeding the 1 MB limit. If `MaxRows` is not provided, Timestream will send the necessary number of rows to meet the 1 MB limit.
            next-token: |-
                A pagination token used to return a set of results. When the `Query` API is invoked using `NextToken`, that particular invocation is assumed to be a subsequent invocation of a prior call to `Query`, and a result set is returned. However, if the `Query` invocation only contains the `ClientToken`, that invocation of `Query` is assumed to be a new query run.

                Note the following when using NextToken in a query:

                - A pagination token can be used for up to five `Query` invocations, OR for a duration of up to 1 hour – whichever comes first.
                - Using the same `NextToken` will return the same set of records. To keep paginating through the result set, you must to use the most recent `nextToken`.
                - Suppose a `Query` invocation returns two `NextToken` values, `TokenA` and `TokenB`. If `TokenB` is used in a subsequent `Query` invocation, then `TokenA` is invalidated and cannot be reused.
                - To request a previous result set from a query after pagination has begun, you must re-invoke the Query API.
                - The latest `NextToken` should be used to paginate until `null` is returned, at which point a new `NextToken` should be used.
                - If the IAM principal of the query initiator and the result reader are not the same and/or the query initiator and the result reader do not have the same query string in the query requests, the query will fail with an `Invalid pagination token` error.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            client-token: |-
                Using a ClientToken makes the call to CreateScheduledQuery idempotent, in other words, making the same request repeatedly will produce the same result. Making multiple identical CreateScheduledQuery requests has the same effect as making a single request.

                - If CreateScheduledQuery is called without a `ClientToken`, the Query SDK generates a `ClientToken` on your behalf.
                - After 8 hours, any request with the same `ClientToken` is treated as a new request.
            error-report-configuration: Configuration for error reporting. Error reports will be generated when a problem is encountered when writing the query results.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon KMS key used to encrypt the scheduled query resource, at-rest. If the Amazon KMS key is not specified, the scheduled query resource will be encrypted with a Timestream owned Amazon KMS key. To specify a KMS key, use the key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix the name with *alias/*

                If ErrorReportConfiguration uses `SSE_KMS` as encryption type, the same KmsKeyId is used to encrypt the error report at rest.
            name: Name of the scheduled query.
            notification-configuration: Notification configuration for the scheduled query. A notification is sent by Timestream when a query run finishes, when the state is updated or when you delete it.
            query-string: |-
                The query string to run. Parameter names can be specified in the query string `@` character followed by an identifier. The named Parameter `@scheduled_runtime` is reserved and can be used in the query to get the time at which the query is scheduled to run.

                The timestamp calculated according to the ScheduleConfiguration parameter, will be the value of `@scheduled_runtime` paramater for each query run. For example, consider an instance of a scheduled query executing on 2021-12-01 00:00:00. For this instance, the `@scheduled_runtime` parameter is initialized to the timestamp 2021-12-01 00:00:00 when invoking the query.
            schedule-configuration: The schedule configuration for the query.
            scheduled-query-execution-role-arn: The ARN for the IAM role that Timestream will assume when running the scheduled query.
            tags: A list of key-value pairs to label the scheduled query.
            target-configuration: Configuration used for writing the result of a query.
