name: list-steps
description: Provides a list of steps for the cluster in reverse order unless you specify `stepIds` with the request or filter by `StepStates`.
flags:
    --cluster-id=!: The identifier of the cluster for which to list the steps.
    --marker=: The maximum number of steps that a single `ListSteps` action returns is 50. To return a longer list of steps, use multiple `ListSteps` actions along with the `Marker` parameter, which is a pagination token that indicates the next set of results to retrieve.
    --step-ids=: The filter to limit the step list based on the identifier of the steps.
    --step-states=: The filter to limit the step list based on certain states.
