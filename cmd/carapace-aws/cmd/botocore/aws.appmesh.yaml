            limit: The maximum number of results returned by `ListRoutes` in paginated output. When you use this parameter, `ListRoutes` returns only `limit` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another `ListRoutes` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, `ListRoutes` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            limit: The maximum number of results returned by `ListVirtualGateways` in paginated output. When you use this parameter, `ListVirtualGateways` returns only `limit` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another `ListVirtualGateways` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, `ListVirtualGateways` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            mesh-name: The name of the service mesh to list virtual gateways in.
            mesh-owner: The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see [Working with shared meshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/sharing.html).
            next-token: The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListVirtualGateways` request where `limit` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic between the applications in your mesh.

            A virtual gateway allows resources outside your mesh to communicate to resources that are inside your mesh. The virtual gateway represents an Envoy proxy running in an Amazon ECS task, in a Kubernetes service, or on an Amazon EC2 instance. Unlike a virtual node, which represents an Envoy running with an application, a virtual gateway represents Envoy deployed by itself.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates a virtual node within a service mesh.

            A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the service discovery information for your task group, and whether the proxy running in a task group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

            You define a `listener` for any inbound traffic that your virtual node expects. Any virtual service that your virtual node expects to communicate to is specified as a `backend`.

            The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the `arn` that is associated with the virtual node. Set this value to the full ARN; for example, `arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:123456789012:myMesh/default/virtualNode/myApp`) as the `APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN` environment variable for your task group's Envoy proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the `node.id` and `node.cluster` Envoy parameters.

            By default, App Mesh uses the name of the resource you specified in `APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN` when Envoy is referring to itself in metrics and traces. You can override this behavior by setting the `APPMESH_RESOURCE_CLUSTER` environment variable with your own name.

            For more information about virtual nodes, see [Virtual nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_nodes.html). You must be using `1.15.0` or later of the Envoy image when setting these variables. For more information aboutApp Mesh Envoy variables, see [Envoy image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html) in the App Mesh User Guide.

            limit: The maximum number of tag results returned by `ListTagsForResource` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListTagsForResource` returns only `limit` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another `ListTagsForResource` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, `ListTagsForResource` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            next-token: The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListTagsForResource` request where `limit` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the resource to list the tags for.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
