            Adds the specified tags to the specified Elastic Load Balancing resource. You can tag your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, target groups, trust stores, listeners, and rules.

            Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. If a resource already has a tag with the same key, `AddTags` updates its value.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            health-check-enabled: Indicates whether health checks are enabled. If the target type is `lambda`, health checks are disabled by default but can be enabled. If the target type is `instance`, `ip`, or `alb`, health checks are always enabled and can't be disabled.
            health-check-interval-seconds: The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. The range is 5-300. If the target group protocol is TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP\_UDP, QUIC, TCP\_QUIC, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 30 seconds. If the target group protocol is GENEVE, the default is 10 seconds. If the target type is `lambda`, the default is 35 seconds.
            health-check-path: |-
                \[HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The destination for health checks on the targets.

                \[HTTP1 or HTTP2 protocol version] The ping path. The default is /.

                \[GRPC protocol version] The path of a custom health check method with the format /package.service/method. The default is /Amazon Web Services.ALB/healthcheck.
            health-check-port: The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. If the protocol is HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP\_UDP, QUIC, or TCP\_QUIC the default is `traffic-port`, which is the port on which each target receives traffic from the load balancer. If the protocol is GENEVE, the default is port 80.
            health-check-protocol: The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. For Application Load Balancers, the default is HTTP. For Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, the default is TCP. The TCP protocol is not supported for health checks if the protocol of the target group is HTTP or HTTPS. The GENEVE, TLS, UDP, TCP\_UDP, QUIC, and TCP\_QUIC protocols are not supported for health checks.
            health-check-timeout-seconds: The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response from a target means a failed health check. The range is 2–120 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP, the default is 6 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TLS or HTTPS, the default is 10 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5 seconds. If the target type is `lambda`, the default is 30 seconds.
            healthy-threshold-count: The number of consecutive health check successes required before considering a target healthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group protocol is TCP, TCP\_UDP, UDP, TLS, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 5. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5. If the target type is `lambda`, the default is 5.
            ip-address-type: The IP address type. The default value is `ipv4`.
            matcher: \[HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TCP\_UDP, UDP, QUIC, TCP\_QUIC, or TLS the range is 200-599. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP or HTTPS, the range is 200-499. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the range is 200-399.
            name: |-
                The name of the target group.

                This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen.
            port: The port on which the targets receive traffic. This port is used unless you specify a port override when registering the target. If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply. If the protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081.
            protocol: The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets. For Application Load Balancers, the supported protocols are HTTP and HTTPS. For Network Load Balancers, the supported protocols are TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP\_UDP, QUIC, or TCP\_QUIC. For Gateway Load Balancers, the supported protocol is GENEVE. A TCP\_UDP listener must be associated with a TCP\_UDP target group. A TCP\_QUIC listener must be associated with a TCP\_QUIC target group. If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply.
            protocol-version: \[HTTP/HTTPS protocol] The protocol version. Specify `GRPC` to send requests to targets using gRPC. Specify `HTTP2` to send requests to targets using HTTP/2. The default is `HTTP1`, which sends requests to targets using HTTP/1.1.
            tags: The tags to assign to the target group.
            target-control-port: The port on which the target control agent and application load balancer exchange management traffic for the target optimizer feature.
            target-type: |-
                The type of target that you must specify when registering targets with this target group. You can't specify targets for a target group using more than one target type.

                - `instance` - Register targets by instance ID. This is the default value.
                - `ip` - Register targets by IP address. You can specify IP addresses from the subnets of the virtual private cloud (VPC) for the target group, the RFC 1918 range (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16), and the RFC 6598 range (100.64.0.0/10). You can't specify publicly routable IP addresses.
                - `lambda` - Register a single Lambda function as a target.
                - `alb` - Register a single Application Load Balancer as a target.
            unhealthy-threshold-count: The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group protocol is TCP, TCP\_UDP, UDP, TLS, QUIC, TCP\_QUIC, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 2. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 2. If the target type is `lambda`, the default is 5.
            vpc-id: The identifier of the virtual private cloud (VPC). If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply. Otherwise, this parameter is required.

        Elastic Load Balancing

        A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the targets.

        Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load balancer types:

        - Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS.
        - Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, UDP, and QUIC.
        - Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).

        For more information, see the [Elastic Load Balancing User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/).

        All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.
