            integration-type: |-
                The integration type of an integration. One of the following:

                AWS: for integrating the route or method request with an AWS service action, including the Lambda function-invoking action. With the Lambda function-invoking action, this is referred to as the Lambda custom integration. With any other AWS service action, this is known as AWS integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                AWS\_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with a Lambda function or other AWS service action. This integration is also referred to as a Lambda proxy integration.

                HTTP: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP endpoint. This integration is also referred to as the HTTP custom integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                HTTP\_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP endpoint, with the client request passed through as-is. This is also referred to as HTTP proxy integration. For HTTP API private integrations, use an HTTP\_PROXY integration.

                MOCK: for integrating the route or method request with API Gateway as a "loopback" endpoint without invoking any backend. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
            integration-uri: |-
                For a Lambda integration, specify the URI of a Lambda function.

                For an HTTP integration, specify a fully-qualified URL.

                For an HTTP API private integration, specify the ARN of an Application Load Balancer listener, Network Load Balancer listener, or AWS Cloud Map service. If you specify the ARN of an AWS Cloud Map service, API Gateway uses DiscoverInstances to identify resources. You can use query parameters to target specific resources. To learn more, see [DiscoverInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DiscoverInstances.html). For private integrations, all resources must be owned by the same AWS account.
            passthrough-behavior: |-
                Specifies the pass-through behavior for incoming requests based on the Content-Type header in the request, and the available mapping templates specified as the requestTemplates property on the Integration resource. There are three valid values: WHEN\_NO\_MATCH, WHEN\_NO\_TEMPLATES, and NEVER. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                WHEN\_NO\_MATCH passes the request body for unmapped content types through to the integration backend without transformation.

                NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

                WHEN\_NO\_TEMPLATES allows pass-through when the integration has no content types mapped to templates. However, if there is at least one content type defined, unmapped content types will be rejected with the same HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.
            payload-format-version: Specifies the format of the payload sent to an integration. Required for HTTP APIs. Supported values for Lambda proxy integrations are 1.0 and 2.0. For all other integrations, 1.0 is the only supported value. To learn more, see [Working with AWS Lambda proxy integrations for HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html).
            request-parameters: |-
                For WebSocket APIs, a key-value map specifying request parameters that are passed from the method request to the backend. The key is an integration request parameter name and the associated value is a method request parameter value or static value that must be enclosed within single quotes and pre-encoded as required by the backend. The method request parameter value must match the pattern of method.request.{location}.{name} , where {location} is querystring, path, or header; and {name} must be a valid and unique method request parameter name.

                For HTTP API integrations with a specified integrationSubtype, request parameters are a key-value map specifying parameters that are passed to AWS\_PROXY integrations. You can provide static values, or map request data, stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see [Working with AWS service integrations for HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-aws-services.html).

                For HTTP API integrations without a specified integrationSubtype request parameters are a key-value map specifying how to transform HTTP requests before sending them to the backend. The key should follow the pattern &lt;action&gt;:&lt;header|querystring|path&gt;.&lt;location&gt; where action can be append, overwrite or remove. For values, you can provide static values, or map request data, stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see [Transforming API requests and responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-parameter-mapping.html).
            request-templates: Represents a map of Velocity templates that are applied on the request payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent by the client. The content type value is the key in this map, and the template (as a String) is the value. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
            response-parameters: Supported only for HTTP APIs. You use response parameters to transform the HTTP response from a backend integration before returning the response to clients. Specify a key-value map from a selection key to response parameters. The selection key must be a valid HTTP status code within the range of 200-599. Response parameters are a key-value map. The key must match pattern &lt;action&gt;:&lt;header&gt;.&lt;location&gt; or overwrite.statuscode. The action can be append, overwrite or remove. The value can be a static value, or map to response data, stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see [Transforming API requests and responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-parameter-mapping.html).
            template-selection-expression: The template selection expression for the integration.
            timeout-in-millis: Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds for WebSocket APIs and between 50 and 30,000 milliseconds for HTTP APIs. The default timeout is 29 seconds for WebSocket APIs and 30 seconds for HTTP APIs.
            tls-config: The TLS configuration for a private integration. If you specify a TLS configuration, private integration traffic uses the HTTPS protocol. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

In general, the URI has this form: arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service\_api} , where {region} is the same as the region hosting the Lambda function, path indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be treated as the path to the resource, including the initial /. For Lambda functions, this is usually of the form /2015-03-31/functions/\[FunctionARN]/invocations. Supported only for REQUEST authorizers.'

                The identity source for which authorization is requested.

                For a REQUEST authorizer, this is optional. The value is a set of one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. The identity source can be headers, query string parameters, stage variables, and context parameters. For example, if an Auth header and a Name query string parameter are defined as identity sources, this value is route.request.header.Auth, route.request.querystring.Name for WebSocket APIs. For HTTP APIs, use selection expressions prefixed with $, for example, $request.header.Auth, $request.querystring.Name. These parameters are used to perform runtime validation for Lambda-based authorizers by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are present in the request, not null, and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function. Otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. For HTTP APIs, identity sources are also used as the cache key when caching is enabled. To learn more, see [Working with AWS Lambda authorizers for HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-lambda-authorizer.html).

                For JWT, a single entry that specifies where to extract the JSON Web Token (JWT) from inbound requests. Currently only header-based and query parameter-based selections are supported, for example $request.header.Authorization.

In general, the URI has this form: arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service\_api} , where {region} is the same as the region hosting the Lambda function, path indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be treated as the path to the resource, including the initial /. For Lambda functions, this is usually of the form /2015-03-31/functions/\[FunctionARN]/invocations. Supported only for REQUEST authorizers.'

                The identity source for which authorization is requested.

                For a REQUEST authorizer, this is optional. The value is a set of one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. The identity source can be headers, query string parameters, stage variables, and context parameters. For example, if an Auth header and a Name query string parameter are defined as identity sources, this value is route.request.header.Auth, route.request.querystring.Name for WebSocket APIs. For HTTP APIs, use selection expressions prefixed with $, for example, $request.header.Auth, $request.querystring.Name. These parameters are used to perform runtime validation for Lambda-based authorizers by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are present in the request, not null, and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function. Otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. For HTTP APIs, identity sources are also used as the cache key when caching is enabled. To learn more, see [Working with AWS Lambda authorizers for HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-lambda-authorizer.html).

            integration-type: |-
                The integration type of an integration. One of the following:

                AWS: for integrating the route or method request with an AWS service action, including the Lambda function-invoking action. With the Lambda function-invoking action, this is referred to as the Lambda custom integration. With any other AWS service action, this is known as AWS integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                AWS\_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with a Lambda function or other AWS service action. This integration is also referred to as a Lambda proxy integration.

                HTTP: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP endpoint. This integration is also referred to as the HTTP custom integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                HTTP\_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP endpoint, with the client request passed through as-is. This is also referred to as HTTP proxy integration. For HTTP API private integrations, use an HTTP\_PROXY integration.

                MOCK: for integrating the route or method request with API Gateway as a "loopback" endpoint without invoking any backend. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
            integration-uri: |-
                For a Lambda integration, specify the URI of a Lambda function.

                For an HTTP integration, specify a fully-qualified URL.

                For an HTTP API private integration, specify the ARN of an Application Load Balancer listener, Network Load Balancer listener, or AWS Cloud Map service. If you specify the ARN of an AWS Cloud Map service, API Gateway uses DiscoverInstances to identify resources. You can use query parameters to target specific resources. To learn more, see [DiscoverInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DiscoverInstances.html). For private integrations, all resources must be owned by the same AWS account.
            passthrough-behavior: |-
                Specifies the pass-through behavior for incoming requests based on the Content-Type header in the request, and the available mapping templates specified as the requestTemplates property on the Integration resource. There are three valid values: WHEN\_NO\_MATCH, WHEN\_NO\_TEMPLATES, and NEVER. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                WHEN\_NO\_MATCH passes the request body for unmapped content types through to the integration backend without transformation.

                NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

                WHEN\_NO\_TEMPLATES allows pass-through when the integration has no content types mapped to templates. However, if there is at least one content type defined, unmapped content types will be rejected with the same HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.
            payload-format-version: Specifies the format of the payload sent to an integration. Required for HTTP APIs. Supported values for Lambda proxy integrations are 1.0 and 2.0. For all other integrations, 1.0 is the only supported value. To learn more, see [Working with AWS Lambda proxy integrations for HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html).
            request-parameters: |-
                For WebSocket APIs, a key-value map specifying request parameters that are passed from the method request to the backend. The key is an integration request parameter name and the associated value is a method request parameter value or static value that must be enclosed within single quotes and pre-encoded as required by the backend. The method request parameter value must match the pattern of method.request.{location}.{name} , where {location} is querystring, path, or header; and {name} must be a valid and unique method request parameter name.

                For HTTP API integrations with a specified integrationSubtype, request parameters are a key-value map specifying parameters that are passed to AWS\_PROXY integrations. You can provide static values, or map request data, stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see [Working with AWS service integrations for HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-aws-services.html).

                For HTTP API integrations, without a specified integrationSubtype request parameters are a key-value map specifying how to transform HTTP requests before sending them to the backend. The key should follow the pattern &lt;action&gt;:&lt;header|querystring|path&gt;.&lt;location&gt; where action can be append, overwrite or remove. For values, you can provide static values, or map request data, stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see [Transforming API requests and responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-parameter-mapping.html).
            request-templates: Represents a map of Velocity templates that are applied on the request payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent by the client. The content type value is the key in this map, and the template (as a String) is the value. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
            response-parameters: Supported only for HTTP APIs. You use response parameters to transform the HTTP response from a backend integration before returning the response to clients. Specify a key-value map from a selection key to response parameters. The selection key must be a valid HTTP status code within the range of 200-599. Response parameters are a key-value map. The key must match pattern &lt;action&gt;:&lt;header&gt;.&lt;location&gt; or overwrite.statuscode. The action can be append, overwrite or remove. The value can be a static value, or map to response data, stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see [Transforming API requests and responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-parameter-mapping.html).
            template-selection-expression: The template selection expression for the integration.
            timeout-in-millis: Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds for WebSocket APIs and between 50 and 30,000 milliseconds for HTTP APIs. The default timeout is 29 seconds for WebSocket APIs and 30 seconds for HTTP APIs.
            tls-config: The TLS configuration for a private integration. If you specify a TLS configuration, private integration traffic uses the HTTPS protocol. Supported only for HTTP APIs.
