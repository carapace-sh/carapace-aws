                If you return the `UsageQuantity` metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking the units into account. For example, if you aggregate `usageQuantity` across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hour or GB). To get more meaningful `UsageQuantity` metrics, filter by `UsageType` or `UsageTypeGroups`.

The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` and `end` is `2017-05-01`, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from `2017-01-01` up to and including `2017-04-30` but not including `2017-05-01`.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

            prediction-interval-level: Amazon Web Services Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction intervals.
            time-period: The start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve usage forecast for. The start date is included in the period, but the end date isn't included in the period. For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` and `end` is `2017-05-01`, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from `2017-01-01` up to and including `2017-04-30` but not including `2017-05-01`. The start date must be equal to or later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

For more information, see [Expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html).

                Valid values are `AmortizedCost`, `BlendedCost`, `NetAmortizedCost`, `NetUnblendedCost`, `NormalizedUsageAmount`, `UnblendedCost`, and `UsageQuantity`.

                If you return the `UsageQuantity` metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate `usageQuantity` across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours and GB). To get more meaningful `UsageQuantity` metrics, filter by `UsageType` or `UsageTypeGroups`.

            next-page-token: The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.
            time-period: Sets the start date and end date for retrieving Amazon Web Services costs. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` and `end` is `2017-05-01`, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from `2017-01-01` up to and including `2017-04-30` but not including `2017-05-01`.

                The `GetCostForecast` operation supports only `DAILY` and `MONTHLY` granularities.
            metric: |-
                Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see [Why does the "blended" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/).

                Valid values for a `GetCostForecast` call are the following:

                - AMORTIZED\_COST
                - BLENDED\_COST
                - NET\_AMORTIZED\_COST

                - UNBLENDED\_COST
            prediction-interval-level: Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction intervals.
            time-period: The period of time that you want the forecast to cover. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

            Gets recommendations for reservation purchases. These recommendations might help you to reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.

            Amazon Web Services generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After Amazon Web Services has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of Reserved Instance (RI) to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.

            For example, Amazon Web Services automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. Amazon Web Services recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible Reserved Instance (RI). Amazon Web Services also shows the equal number of normalized units. This way, you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation is for `c4.large` because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.
