        command: |-
            Starts a new run and returns details about the run, or duplicates an existing run. A run is a single invocation of a workflow. If you provide request IDs, Amazon Web Services HealthOmics identifies duplicate requests and starts the run only once. Monitor the progress of the run by calling the `GetRun` API operation.

            To start a new run, the following inputs are required:

            - A service role ARN (`roleArn`).
            - The run's workflow ID (`workflowId`, not the `uuid` or `runId`).
            - An Amazon S3 location (`outputUri`) where the run outputs will be saved.
            - All required workflow parameters (`parameter`), which can include optional parameters from the parameter template. The run cannot include any parameters that are not defined in the parameter template. To see all possible parameters, use the `GetRun` API operation.
            - For runs with a `STATIC` (default) storage type, specify the required storage capacity (in gibibytes). A storage capacity value is not required for runs that use `DYNAMIC` storage.

            `StartRun` can also duplicate an existing run using the run's default values. You can modify these default values and/or add other optional inputs. To duplicate a run, the following inputs are required:

            - A service role ARN (`roleArn`).
            - The ID of the run to duplicate (`runId`).
            - An Amazon S3 location where the run outputs will be saved (`outputUri`).

            To learn more about the optional parameters for `StartRun`, see [Starting a run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/starting-a-run.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.

            Use the `retentionMode` input to control how long the metadata for each run is stored in CloudWatch. There are two retention modes:

            - Specify `REMOVE` to automatically remove the oldest runs when you reach the maximum service retention limit for runs. It is recommended that you use the `REMOVE` mode to initiate major run requests so that your runs do not fail when you reach the limit.
            - The `retentionMode` is set to the `RETAIN` mode by default, which allows you to manually remove runs after reaching the maximum service retention limit. Under this setting, you cannot create additional runs until you remove the excess runs.

            To learn more about the retention modes, see [Run retention mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/run-retention.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.

            You can use Amazon Q CLI to analyze run logs and make performance optimization recommendations. To get started, see the [Amazon Web Services HealthOmics MCP server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-healthomics-mcp-server) on GitHub.
        flag:
            cache-behavior: The cache behavior for the run. You specify this value if you want to override the default behavior for the cache. You had set the default value when you created the cache.

            log-level: A log level for the run.
            name: A name for the run. This is recommended to view and organize runs in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics console and CloudWatch logs.
            output-uri: An output S3 URI for the run. The S3 bucket must be in the same region as the workflow. The role ARN must have permission to write to this S3 bucket.
            parameters: Parameters for the run. The run needs all required parameters and can include optional parameters. The run cannot include any parameters that are not defined in the parameter template. To retrieve parameters from the run, use the GetRun API operation.
            priority: 'Use the run priority (highest: 1) to establish the order of runs in a run group when you start a run. If multiple runs share the same priority, the run that was initiated first will have the higher priority. Runs that do not belong to a run group can be assigned a priority. The priorities of these runs are ranked among other runs that are not in a run group. For more information, see [Run priority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/creating-run-groups.html#run-priority) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.'
            request-id: An idempotency token used to dedupe retry requests so that duplicate runs are not created.
            retention-mode: |-
                The retention mode for the run. The default value is `RETAIN`.

                Amazon Web Services HealthOmics stores a fixed number of runs that are available to the console and API. In the default mode (`RETAIN`), you need to remove runs manually when the number of run exceeds the maximum. If you set the retention mode to `REMOVE`, Amazon Web Services HealthOmics automatically removes runs (that have mode set to `REMOVE`) when the number of run exceeds the maximum. All run logs are available in CloudWatch logs, if you need information about a run that is no longer available to the API.

                For more information about retention mode, see [Specifying run retention mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/starting-a-run.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.
            role-arn: A service role for the run. The `roleArn` requires access to Amazon Web Services HealthOmics, S3, Cloudwatch logs, and EC2. An example `roleArn` is `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/omics-service-role-serviceRole-W8O1XMPL7QZ`. In this example, the AWS account ID is `123456789012` and the role name is `omics-service-role-serviceRole-W8O1XMPL7QZ`.
            run-group-id: The run's group ID. Use a run group to cap the compute resources (and number of concurrent runs) for the runs that you add to the run group.
            run-id: The ID of a run to duplicate.
            storage-capacity: The `STATIC` storage capacity (in gibibytes, GiB) for this run. The default run storage capacity is 1200 GiB. If your requested storage capacity is unavailable, the system rounds up the value to the nearest 1200 GiB multiple. If the requested storage capacity is still unavailable, the system rounds up the value to the nearest 2400 GiB multiple. This field is not required if the storage type is `DYNAMIC` (the system ignores any value that you enter).
            storage-type: The storage type for the run. If you set the storage type to `DYNAMIC`, Amazon Web Services HealthOmics dynamically scales the storage up or down, based on file system utilization. By default, the run uses `STATIC` storage type, which allocates a fixed amount of storage. For more information about `DYNAMIC` and `STATIC` storage, see [Run storage types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/workflows-run-types.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.
            tags: Tags for the run. You can add up to 50 tags per run. For more information, see [Adding a tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/add-a-tag.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.
            workflow-id: The run's workflow ID. The `workflowId` is not the UUID.
            workflow-owner-id: The 12-digit account ID of the workflow owner that is used for running a shared workflow. The workflow owner ID can be retrieved using the `GetShare` API operation. If you are the workflow owner, you do not need to include this ID.
            workflow-type: The run's workflow type. The `workflowType` must be specified if you are running a `READY2RUN` workflow. If you are running a `PRIVATE` workflow (default), you do not need to include the workflow type.
            workflow-version-name: The name of the workflow version. Use workflow versions to track and organize changes to the workflow. If your workflow has multiple versions, the run uses the default version unless you specify a version name. To learn more, see [Workflow versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/workflow-versions.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.

            Creates a sequence store and returns its metadata. Sequence stores are used to store sequence data files called read sets that are saved in FASTQ, BAM, uBAM, or CRAM formats. For aligned formats (BAM and CRAM), a sequence store can only use one reference genome. For unaligned formats (FASTQ and uBAM), a reference genome is not required. You can create multiple sequence stores per region per account.

            The following are optional parameters you can specify for your sequence store:

            - Use `s3AccessConfig` to configure your sequence store with S3 access logs (recommended).
            - Use `sseConfig` to define your own KMS key for encryption.
            - Use `eTagAlgorithmFamily` to define which algorithm to use for the HealthOmics eTag on objects.
            - Use `fallbackLocation` to define a backup location for storing files that have failed a direct upload.
            - Use `propagatedSetLevelTags` to configure tags that propagate to all objects in your store.

            Initiates a multipart read set upload for uploading partitioned source files into a sequence store. You can directly import source files from an EC2 instance and other local compute, or from an S3 bucket. To separate these source files into parts, use the `split` operation. Each part cannot be larger than 100 MB. If the operation is successful, it provides an `uploadId` which is required by the `UploadReadSetPart` API operation to upload parts into a sequence store.

            To continue uploading a multipart read set into your sequence store, you must use the `UploadReadSetPart` API operation to upload each part individually following the steps below:

            - Specify the `uploadId` obtained from the previous call to `CreateMultipartReadSetUpload`.
            - Upload parts for that `uploadId`.

            When you have finished uploading parts, use the `CompleteMultipartReadSetUpload` API to complete the multipart read set upload and to retrieve the final read set IDs in the response.

            To learn more about creating parts and the `split` operation, see [Direct upload to a sequence store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/synchronous-uploads.html) in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.
