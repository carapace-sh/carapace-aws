            Creates an experiment template.

            An experiment template includes the following components:

            - **Targets**: A target can be a specific resource in your Amazon Web Services environment, or one or more resources that match criteria that you specify, for example, resources that have specific tags.
            - **Actions**: The actions to carry out on the target. You can specify multiple actions, the duration of each action, and when to start each action during an experiment.
            - **Stop conditions**: If a stop condition is triggered while an experiment is running, the experiment is automatically stopped. You can define a stop condition as a CloudWatch alarm.

            For more information, see [experiment templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/experiment-templates.html) in the *Fault Injection Service User Guide*.
