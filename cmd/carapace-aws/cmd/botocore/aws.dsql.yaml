            The *UpdateCluster* API allows you to modify both single-Region and multi-Region cluster configurations. With the *multiRegionProperties* parameter, you can add or modify witness Region support and manage peer relationships with clusters in other Regions.

            Note that updating multi-Region clusters requires additional IAM permissions beyond those needed for standard cluster updates, as detailed in the Permissions section.

            **Required permissions**

            dsql:UpdateCluster

            Permission to update a DSQL cluster.

            Resources: `arn:aws:dsql:region:account-id:cluster/cluster-id`

            dsql:PutMultiRegionProperties

            Permission to configure multi-Region properties for a cluster.

            Resources: `arn:aws:dsql:region:account-id:cluster/cluster-id`

            dsql:GetCluster

            Permission to retrieve cluster information.

            Resources: `arn:aws:dsql:region:account-id:cluster/cluster-id`

            dsql:AddPeerCluster

            Permission to add peer clusters.

            Resources:

            - Local cluster: `arn:aws:dsql:region:account-id:cluster/cluster-id`
            - Each peer cluster: exact ARN of each specified peer cluster

            dsql:RemovePeerCluster

            Permission to remove peer clusters. The *dsql:RemovePeerCluster* permission uses a wildcard ARN pattern to simplify permission management during updates.

            Resources: `arn:aws:dsql:*:account-id:cluster/*`

            dsql:PutWitnessRegion

            Permission to set a witness Region.

            Resources: `arn:aws:dsql:region:account-id:cluster/cluster-id`

            Condition Keys: dsql:WitnessRegion (matching the specified witness Region)

            **This permission is checked both in the cluster Region and in the witness Region.**

            - The witness region specified in `multiRegionProperties.witnessRegion` cannot be the same as the cluster's Region.
            - When updating clusters with peer relationships, permissions are checked for both adding and removing peers.
            - The `dsql:RemovePeerCluster` permission uses a wildcard ARN pattern to simplify permission management during updates.
