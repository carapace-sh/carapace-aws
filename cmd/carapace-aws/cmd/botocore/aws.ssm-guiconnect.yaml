        AWS Systems Manager GUI Connect

        Systems Manager GUI Connect, a component of Fleet Manager, lets you connect to your Window Server-type Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). GUI Connect, which is powered by [Amazon DCV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html), provides you with secure connectivity to your Windows Server instances directly from the Systems Manager console. You can have up to four simultaneous connections in a single browser window. In the console, GUI Connect is also referred to as Fleet Manager Remote Desktop.

        This reference is intended to be used with the [*Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/) . To get started, see the following user guide topics:
