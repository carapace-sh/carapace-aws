                Pre-processes and validates the environment manifest (`env.yaml`) and configuration files (`*.config` files in the `.ebextensions` folder) in the source bundle. Validating configuration files can identify issues prior to deploying the application version to an environment.

                You must turn processing on for application versions that you create using AWS CodeBuild or AWS CodeCommit. For application versions built from a source bundle in Amazon S3, processing is optional.

                The `Process` option validates Elastic Beanstalk configuration files. It doesn't validate your application's configuration files, like proxy server or Docker configuration.

                Specify a source bundle in S3 or a commit in an AWS CodeCommit repository (with `SourceBuildInformation`), but not both. If neither `SourceBundle` nor `SourceBuildInformation` are provided, Elastic Beanstalk uses a sample application.

You define application configuration settings in a configuration template. You can then use the configuration template to deploy different versions of the application with the same configuration settings.

            Templates aren't associated with any environment. The `EnvironmentName` response element is always `null`.

            Setting the `InfoType` to `tail` compiles the last lines from the application server log files of every Amazon EC2 instance in your environment.

            Setting the `InfoType` to `bundle` compresses the application server log files for every Amazon EC2 instance into a `.zip` file. Legacy and .NET containers do not support bundle logs.

            Returns a description of the settings for the specified configuration set, that is, either a configuration template or the configuration set associated with a running environment.

            When describing the settings for the configuration set associated with a running environment, it is possible to receive two sets of setting descriptions. One is the deployed configuration set, and the other is a draft configuration of an environment that is either in the process of deployment or that failed to deploy.

                    If no `MaxRecords` is specified, all available environments are retrieved in a single response.
                next-token: |-
                    For a paginated request. Specify a token from a previous response page to retrieve the next response page. All other parameter values must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

                    If no `NextToken` is specified, the first page is retrieved.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                    Indicates whether to include deleted environments:

                    `true`: Environments that have been deleted after `IncludedDeletedBackTo` are displayed.

                    `false`: Do not include deleted environments.

                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.

                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                max-records: |-
                    For a paginated request. Specify a maximum number of environments to include in each response.

                    If no `MaxRecords` is specified, all available environments are retrieved in a single response.
