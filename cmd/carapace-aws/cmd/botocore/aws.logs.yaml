            Uploads a batch of log events to the specified log stream.

            The sequence token is now ignored in `PutLogEvents` actions. `PutLogEvents` actions are always accepted and never return `InvalidSequenceTokenException` or `DataAlreadyAcceptedException` even if the sequence token is not valid. You can use parallel `PutLogEvents` actions on the same log stream.

            The batch of events must satisfy the following constraints:

            - The maximum batch size is 1,048,576 bytes. This size is calculated as the sum of all event messages in UTF-8, plus 26 bytes for each log event.
            - Events more than 2 hours in the future are rejected while processing remaining valid events.
            - Events older than 14 days or preceding the log group's retention period are rejected while processing remaining valid events.
            - The log events in the batch must be in chronological order by their timestamp. The timestamp is the time that the event occurred, expressed as the number of milliseconds after `Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC`. (In Amazon Web Services Tools for PowerShell and the Amazon Web Services SDK for .NET, the timestamp is specified in .NET format: `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`. For example, `2017-09-15T13:45:30`.)
            - A batch of log events in a single request must be in a chronological order. Otherwise, the operation fails.
            - Each log event can be no larger than 1 MB.
            - The maximum number of log events in a batch is 10,000.
            - For valid events (within 14 days in the past to 2 hours in future), the time span in a single batch cannot exceed 24 hours. Otherwise, the operation fails.

            The quota of five requests per second per log stream has been removed. Instead, `PutLogEvents` actions are throttled based on a per-second per-account quota. You can request an increase to the per-second throttling quota by using the Service Quotas service.

            If a call to `PutLogEvents` returns "UnrecognizedClientException" the most likely cause is a non-valid Amazon Web Services access key ID or secret key.

            Creates or updates a metric filter and associates it with the specified log group. With metric filters, you can configure rules to extract metric data from log events ingested through [PutLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html).

            The maximum number of metric filters that can be associated with a log group is 100.

            Using regular expressions in filter patterns is supported. For these filters, there is a quota of two regular expression patterns within a single filter pattern. There is also a quota of five regular expression patterns per log group. For more information about using regular expressions in filter patterns, see [Filter pattern syntax for metric filters, subscription filters, filter log events, and Live Tail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).

            When you create a metric filter, you can also optionally assign a unit and dimensions to the metric that is created.

            Metrics extracted from log events are charged as custom metrics. To prevent unexpected high charges, do not specify high-cardinality fields such as `IPAddress` or `requestID` as dimensions. Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric.

            CloudWatch Logs might disable a metric filter if it generates 1,000 different name/value pairs for your specified dimensions within one hour.

            You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are higher than expected. For more information, see [Creating a Billing Alarm to Monitor Your Estimated Amazon Web Services Charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html).

                If the log group uses either a log-group level or account-level transformer, and you specify `true`, the metric filter will be applied on the transformed version of the log events instead of the original ingested log events.

            Creates an export task so that you can efficiently export data from a log group to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform a `CreateExportTask` operation, you must use credentials that have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify as the destination.

            Exporting log data to S3 buckets that are encrypted by KMS is supported. Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that have S3 Object Lock enabled with a retention period is also supported.

            Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported.

            This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After the task has started, you can use [DescribeExportTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeExportTasks.html) to get the status of the export task. Each account can only have one active (`RUNNING` or `PENDING`) export task at a time. To cancel an export task, use [CancelExportTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CancelExportTask.html).

            You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the same S3 bucket. To separate log data for each export task, specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all exported objects.

            We recommend that you don't regularly export to Amazon S3 as a way to continuously archive your logs. For that use case, we instead recommend that you use subscriptions. For more information about subscriptions, see [Real-time processing of log data with subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Subscriptions.html).

            Time-based sorting on chunks of log data inside an exported file is not guaranteed. You can sort the exported log field data by using Linux utilities.

            Creates a data protection policy for the specified log group. A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by the log group by auditing and masking the sensitive log data.

            Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into the log group. When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log group before that time are not masked.

            By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the `logs:Unmask` permission can use a [GetLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html) or [FilterLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_FilterLogEvents.html) operation with the `unmask` parameter set to `true` to view the unmasked log events. Users with the `logs:Unmask` can also view unmasked data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query with the `unmask` query command.

            For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and masked, see [Protect sensitive log data with masking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html).

            The `PutDataProtectionPolicy` operation applies to only the specified log group. You can also use [PutAccountPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html) to create an account-level data protection policy that applies to all log groups in the account, including both existing log groups and log groups that are created level. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.

        command: |-
            Creates or updates a *log transformer* for a single log group. You use log transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contains relevant, source-specific information.

            After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs the transformations at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filers.

            You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region.

            A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. The processors work one after another, in the order that you list them, like a pipeline. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see [Processors that you can use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors).

            Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies.

            You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.

            You can also set up a transformer at the account level. For more information, see [PutAccountPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html). If there is both a log-group level transformer created with `PutTransformer` and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer.

You specify the log groups and time range to query and the query string to use.\n\nFor more information, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html).\n\nAfter you run a query using `StartQuery`, the query results are stored by CloudWatch Logs. You can use [GetQueryResults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueryResults.html) to retrieve the results of a query, using the `queryId` that `StartQuery` returns.\n\nTo specify the log groups to query, a `StartQuery` operation must include one of the following:\n\n- Either exactly one of the following parameters: `logGroupName`, `logGroupNames`, or `logGroupIdentifiers`\n- Or the `queryString` must include a `SOURCE` command to select log groups for the query. The `SOURCE` command can select log groups based on log group name prefix, account ID, and log class.\n  \n  For more information about the `SOURCE` command, see [SOURCE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax-Source.html).\n\nIf you have associated a KMS key with the query results in this account, then [StartQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartQuery.html) uses that key to encrypt the results when it stores them. If no key is associated with query results, the query results are encrypted with the default CloudWatch Logs encryption method.\n\nQueries time out after 60 minutes of runtime. If your queries are timing out, reduce the time range being searched or partition your query into a number of queries.\n\nIf you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account to start a query in a linked source account. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html). For a cross-account `StartQuery` operation, the query definition must be defined in the monitoring account.\n\nYou can have up to 30 concurrent CloudWatch Logs insights queries, including queries that have been added to dashboards."

            `GetLogEvents` is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1 MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB.

            Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. As long as the `nextBackwardToken` or `nextForwardToken` returned is NOT equal to the `nextToken` that you passed into the API call, there might be more log events available. The token that you use depends on the direction you want to move in along the log stream. The returned tokens are never null.

            If you set `startFromHead` to `true` and you don’t include `endTime` in your request, you can end up in a situation where the pagination doesn't terminate. This can happen when the new log events are being added to the target log streams faster than they are being read. This situation is a good use case for the CloudWatch Logs [Live Tail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs_LiveTail.html) feature.

            If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html).

            You can specify the log group to search by using either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName`. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.

            If you are using [log transformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html), the `GetLogEvents` operation returns only the original versions of log events, before they were transformed. To view the transformed versions, you must use a [CloudWatch Logs query.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html)

                - The `Standard` log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features.
                - The `Infrequent Access` log class supports a subset of CloudWatch Logs features and incurs lower costs.
                - Use the `Delivery` log class only for delivering Lambda logs to store in Amazon S3 or Amazon Data Firehose. Log events in log groups in the Delivery class are kept in CloudWatch Logs for only one day. This log class doesn't offer rich CloudWatch Logs capabilities such as CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.

If you are using this operation in an account that is not a cross-account monitoring account, you can specify only log group names in the same account as the operation.

For example, if you specify `DataLogs`, log groups named `DataLogs`, `aws/DataLogs`, and `GroupDataLogs` would match, but `datalogs`, `Data/log/s` and `Groupdata` would not match.

                If you specify `logGroupNamePattern` in your request, then only `arn`, `creationTime`, and `logGroupName` are included in the response.

        command: |-
            Lists log events from the specified log group. You can list all the log events or filter the results using one or more of the following:

            - A filter pattern
            - A time range
            - The log stream name, or a log stream name prefix that matches multiple log streams

            You must have the `logs:FilterLogEvents` permission to perform this operation.

            You can specify the log group to search by using either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName`. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.

            `FilterLogEvents` is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1 MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB.

            Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. If the results include a `nextToken`, there might be more log events available. You can return these additional log events by providing the nextToken in a subsequent `FilterLogEvents` operation. If the results don't include a `nextToken`, then pagination is finished.

            Specifying the `limit` parameter only guarantees that a single page doesn't return more log events than the specified limit, but it might return fewer events than the limit. This is the expected API behavior.

            The returned log events are sorted by event timestamp, the timestamp when the event was ingested by CloudWatch Logs, and the ID of the `PutLogEvents` request.

            If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html).

            If you are using [log transformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html), the `FilterLogEvents` operation returns only the original versions of log events, before they were transformed. To view the transformed versions, you must use a [CloudWatch Logs query.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html)

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates or updates a *field index policy* for the specified log group. Only log groups in the Standard log class support field index policies. For more information about log classes, see [Log classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html).

            You can use field index policies to create *field indexes* on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes speeds up and lowers the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html).

            To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the [GetLogGroupFields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogGroupFields.html) operation.

            For example, suppose you have created a field index for `requestId`. Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes `requestId = value` or `requestId IN [value, value, ...]` will process fewer log events to reduce costs, and have improved performance.

            CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following fields:

            - `@logStream`
            - `@aws.region`
            - `@aws.account`
            - `@source.log`
            - `traceId`

            Default field indexes are in addition to any custom field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your field index quota.

            Each index policy has the following quotas and restrictions:

            - As many as 20 fields can be included in the policy.
            - Each field name can include as many as 100 characters.

            Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, a field index of `RequestId` won't match a log event containing `requestId`.

            Log group-level field index policies created with `PutIndexPolicy` override account-level field index policies created with [PutAccountPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html). If you use `PutIndexPolicy` to create a field index policy for a log group, that log group uses only that policy. The log group ignores any account-wide field index policy that you might have created.

            - If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use [PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html) in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
            - Use `CreateDelivery` to create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination.

            You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

            To update an existing delivery configuration, use [UpdateDeliveryConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDeliveryConfiguration.html).

            Creates or updates a logical *delivery destination*. A delivery destination is an Amazon Web Services resource that represents an Amazon Web Services service that logs can be sent to. CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, and Firehose are supported as logs delivery destinations and X-Ray as the trace delivery destination.

            To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services service and a destination, you must do the following:

            - Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see [PutDeliverySource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html).
            - Use `PutDeliveryDestination` to create a *delivery destination* in the same account of the actual delivery destination. The delivery destination that you create is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination.
            - If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use [PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html) in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
            - Use `CreateDelivery` to create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see [CreateDelivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html).

            You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

            Only some Amazon Web Services services support being configured as a delivery source. These services are listed as **Supported \[V2 Permissions]** in the table at [Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html)

            If you use this operation to update an existing delivery destination, all the current delivery destination parameters are overwritten with the new parameter values that you specify.

            CloudWatch Logs doesn't immediately delete log events when they reach their retention setting. It typically takes up to 72 hours after that before log events are deleted, but in rare situations might take longer.

            To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a longer retention setting when it contains log events that are past the expiration date, but haven't been deleted. Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively, wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are deleted.

            When log events reach their retention setting they are marked for deletion. After they are marked for deletion, they do not add to your archival storage costs anymore, even if they are not actually deleted until later. These log events marked for deletion are also not included when you use an API to retrieve the `storedBytes` value to see how many bytes a log group is storing.

            Creates an *anomaly detector* that regularly scans one or more log groups and look for patterns and anomalies in the logs.

            An anomaly detector can help surface issues by automatically discovering anomalies in your log event traffic. An anomaly detector uses machine learning algorithms to scan log events and find *patterns*. A pattern is a shared text structure that recurs among your log fields. Patterns provide a useful tool for analyzing large sets of logs because a large number of log events can often be compressed into a few patterns.

            The anomaly detector uses pattern recognition to find `anomalies`, which are unusual log events. It uses the `evaluationFrequency` to compare current log events and patterns with trained baselines.

            Fields within a pattern are called *tokens*. Fields that vary within a pattern, such as a request ID or timestamp, are referred to as *dynamic tokens* and represented by `<*>`.

            The following is an example of a pattern:

            `[INFO] Request time: <*> ms`

            This pattern represents log events like `[INFO] Request time: 327 ms` and other similar log events that differ only by the number, in this csse 327. When the pattern is displayed, the different numbers are replaced by `<*>`

            Any parts of log events that are masked as sensitive data are not scanned for anomalies. For more information about masking sensitive data, see [Help protect sensitive log data with masking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html).
        flag:
            anomaly-visibility-time: The number of days to have visibility on an anomaly. After this time period has elapsed for an anomaly, it will be automatically baselined and the anomaly detector will treat new occurrences of a similar anomaly as normal. Therefore, if you do not correct the cause of an anomaly during the time period specified in `anomalyVisibilityTime`, it will be considered normal going forward and will not be detected as an anomaly.

            Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create destinations for cross-account subscriptions.

            A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream). With a destination, you can subscribe to a real-time stream of log events for a different account, ingested using [PutLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html).

            Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it. By default, `PutDestination` does not set any access policy with the destination, which means a cross-account user cannot call [PutSubscriptionFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutSubscriptionFilter.html) against this destination. To enable this, the destination owner must call [PutDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestinationPolicy.html) after `PutDestination`.

            To perform a `PutDestination` operation, you must also have the `iam:PassRole` permission.

            **Data protection policy**

            A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by your log groups by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. Each account can have only one account-level data protection policy.

            Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into a log group. When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log groups before that time are not masked.

            If you use `PutAccountPolicy` to create a data protection policy for your whole account, it applies to both existing log groups and all log groups that are created later in this account. The account-level policy is applied to existing log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up to 5 minutes before sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked.

            By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the `logs:Unmask` permission can use a [GetLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html) or [FilterLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_FilterLogEvents.html) operation with the `unmask` parameter set to `true` to view the unmasked log events. Users with the `logs:Unmask` can also view unmasked data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query with the `unmask` query command.

            For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and masked, see [Protect sensitive log data with masking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html).

            To use the `PutAccountPolicy` operation for a data protection policy, you must be signed on with the `logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy` and `logs:PutAccountPolicy` permissions.

            The `PutAccountPolicy` operation applies to all log groups in the account. You can use [PutDataProtectionPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDataProtectionPolicy.html) to create a data protection policy that applies to just one log group. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.

            **Subscription filter policy**

            A subscription filter policy sets up a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs to other Amazon Web Services services. Account-level subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups that are created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose, and Lambda. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.

            The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:

            - An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
            - An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
            - A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
            - A logical destination in a different account created with [PutDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html), for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations.

            Each account can have one account-level subscription filter policy per Region. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in `PolicyName`. To perform a `PutAccountPolicy` subscription filter operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the `iam:PassRole` permission.

            **Transformer policy**

            Creates or updates a *log transformer policy* for your account. You use log transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contain relevant, source-specific information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs this transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filters.

            You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region.

            A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see [Processors that you can use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors).

            Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies.

            You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.

            You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the `selectionCriteria` parameter. If you have multiple account-level transformer policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with `my-log`, you can't have another field index policy filtered to `my-logpprod` or `my-logging`.

            CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following fields:

            - `@logStream`
            - `@aws.region`
            - `@aws.account`
            - `@source.log`
            - `traceId`

            Default field indexes are in addition to any custom field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your field index quota.

            You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information, see [PutTransformer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutTransformer.html). If there is both a log-group level transformer created with `PutTransformer` and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer.

            **Field index policy**

            You can use field index policies to create indexes on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes can help lower the scan volume for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those fields, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, user IDs, or instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html)

            To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the [GetLogGroupFields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogGroupFields.html) operation.

            For example, suppose you have created a field index for `requestId`. Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes `requestId = value` or `requestId in [value, value, ...]` will attempt to process only the log events where the indexed field matches the specified value.

            Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, an indexed field of `RequestId` won't match a log event containing `requestId`.

            You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the `selectionCriteria` parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with `my-log`, you can't have another field index policy filtered to `my-logpprod` or `my-logging`.

            If you create an account-level field index policy in a monitoring account in cross-account observability, the policy is applied only to the monitoring account and not to any source accounts.

            If you want to create a field index policy for a single log group, you can use [PutIndexPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutIndexPolicy.html) instead of `PutAccountPolicy`. If you do so, that log group will use only that log-group level policy, and will ignore the account-level policy that you create with [PutAccountPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html).

            **Metric extraction policy**

            A metric extraction policy controls whether CloudWatch Metrics can be created through the Embedded Metrics Format (EMF) for log groups in your account. By default, EMF metric creation is enabled for all log groups. You can use metric extraction policies to disable EMF metric creation for your entire account or specific log groups.

            When a policy disables EMF metric creation for a log group, log events in the EMF format are still ingested, but no CloudWatch Metrics are created from them.

            Creating a policy disables metrics for AWS features that use EMF to create metrics, such as CloudWatch Container Insights and CloudWatch Application Signals. To prevent turning off those features by accident, we recommend that you exclude the underlying log-groups through a selection-criteria such as `LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/containerinsights", "/aws/ecs/containerinsights", "/aws/application-signals/data"]`.

            Each account can have either one account-level metric extraction policy that applies to all log groups, or up to 5 policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the `selectionCriteria` parameter. The selection criteria supports filtering by `LogGroupName` and `LogGroupNamePrefix` using the operators `IN` and `NOT IN`. You can specify up to 50 values in each `IN` or `NOT IN` list.

            The selection criteria can be specified in these formats:

            `LogGroupName IN ["log-group-1", "log-group-2"]`

            `LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/prefix1", "/aws/prefix2"]`

            If you have multiple account-level metric extraction policies with selection criteria, no two of them can have overlapping criteria. For example, if you have one policy with selection criteria `LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["my-log"]`, you can't have another metric extraction policy with selection criteria `LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-log-prod"]` or `LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-logging"]`, as the set of log groups matching these prefixes would be a subset of the log groups matching the first policy's prefix, creating an overlap.

            When using `NOT IN`, only one policy with this operator is allowed per account.

            When combining policies with `IN` and `NOT IN` operators, the overlap check ensures that policies don't have conflicting effects. Two policies with `IN` and `NOT IN` operators do not overlap if and only if every value in the `IN`policy is completely contained within some value in the `NOT IN` policy. For example:

            - If you have a `NOT IN` policy for prefix `"/aws/lambda"`, you can create an `IN` policy for the exact log group name `"/aws/lambda/function1"` because the set of log groups matching `"/aws/lambda/function1"` is a subset of the log groups matching `"/aws/lambda"`.
            - If you have a `NOT IN` policy for prefix `"/aws/lambda"`, you cannot create an `IN` policy for prefix `"/aws"` because the set of log groups matching `"/aws"` is not a subset of the log groups matching `"/aws/lambda"`.

With subscription filters, you can subscribe to a real-time stream of log events ingested through [PutLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html) and have them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.

            The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:

            - An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
            - A logical destination created with [PutDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html) that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery. We currently support Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose as logical destinations.
            - An Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
            - An Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

            Each log group can have up to two subscription filters associated with it. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in `filterName`.

            Using regular expressions in filter patterns is supported. For these filters, there is a quotas of quota of two regular expression patterns within a single filter pattern. There is also a quota of five regular expression patterns per log group. For more information about using regular expressions in filter patterns, see [Filter pattern syntax for metric filters, subscription filters, filter log events, and Live Tail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).

            To perform a `PutSubscriptionFilter` operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the `iam:PassRole` permission.
        flag:
            apply-on-transformed-logs: |-
                This parameter is valid only for log groups that have an active log transformer. For more information about log transformers, see [PutTransformer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutTransformer.html).

                If the log group uses either a log-group level or account-level transformer, and you specify `true`, the subscription filter will be applied on the transformed version of the log events instead of the original ingested log events.

Each field is truncated as needed to keep the total event size as close to 1MB as possible. The excess portions are stored as Large Log Objects (LLOs) and these fields are processed separately and LLO reference system fields (in the format `@ptr.$[path.to.field]`) are added. The path in the reference field reflects the original JSON structure where the large field was located. For example, this could be `@ptr.$['input']['message']`, `@ptr.$['AAA']['BBB']['CCC']['DDD']`, `@ptr.$['AAA']`, or any other path matching your log structure.

            Creates and assigns an IAM policy that grants permissions to CloudWatch Logs to deliver logs cross-account to a specified destination in this account. To configure the delivery of logs from an Amazon Web Services service in another account to a logs delivery destination in the current account, you must do the following:

            - Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see [PutDeliverySource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html).
            - Create a *delivery destination*, which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination. For more information, see [PutDeliveryDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html).
            - Use this operation in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
            - Create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see [CreateDelivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html).

            Only some Amazon Web Services services support being configured as a delivery source. These services are listed as **Supported \[V2 Permissions]** in the table at [Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html)

            The contents of the policy must include two statements. One statement enables general logs delivery, and the other allows delivery to the chosen destination. See the examples for the needed policies.

            Creates or updates a logical *delivery source*. A delivery source represents an Amazon Web Services resource that sends logs to an logs delivery destination. The destination can be CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, Firehose or X-Ray for sending traces.

            To configure logs delivery between a delivery destination and an Amazon Web Services service that is supported as a delivery source, you must do the following:

            - Use `PutDeliverySource` to create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs.
            - Use `PutDeliveryDestination` to create a *delivery destination*, which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination. For more information, see [PutDeliveryDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html).
            - If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use [PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html) in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
            - Use `CreateDelivery` to create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see [CreateDelivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html).

            You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

            Only some Amazon Web Services services support being configured as a delivery source. These services are listed as **Supported \[V2 Permissions]** in the table at [Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html)

            If you use this operation to update an existing delivery source, all the current delivery source parameters are overwritten with the new parameter values that you specify.

            Creates a log group with the specified name. You can create up to 1,000,000 log groups per Region per account.

            You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:

            - Log group names must be unique within a Region for an Amazon Web Services account.
            - Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.
            - Log group names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '\_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward slash), '.' (period), and '#' (number sign)
            - Log group names can't start with the string `aws/`

            When you create a log group, by default the log events in the log group do not expire. To set a retention policy so that events expire and are deleted after a specified time, use [PutRetentionPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutRetentionPolicy.html).

            If you associate an KMS key with the log group, ingested data is encrypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.

            If you attempt to associate a KMS key with the log group but the KMS key does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an `InvalidParameterException` error.

            CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not associate an asymmetric KMS key with your log group. For more information, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html).

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

            kms-key-id: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use when encrypting log data. For more information, see [Amazon Resource Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kms).
            log-group-class: |-
                Use this parameter to specify the log group class for this log group. There are three classes:

                - The `Standard` log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features.
                - The `Infrequent Access` log class supports a subset of CloudWatch Logs features and incurs lower costs.
                - Use the `Delivery` log class only for delivering Lambda logs to store in Amazon S3 or Amazon Data Firehose. Log events in log groups in the Delivery class are kept in CloudWatch Logs for only one day. This log class doesn't offer rich CloudWatch Logs capabilities such as CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.

                If you omit this parameter, the default of `STANDARD` is used.

                The value of `logGroupClass` can't be changed after a log group is created.

                For details about the features supported by each class, see [Log classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html)
            log-group-name: A name for the log group.
            tags: |-
                The key-value pairs to use for the tags.

                You can grant users access to certain log groups while preventing them from accessing other log groups. To do so, tag your groups and use IAM policies that refer to those tags. To assign tags when you create a log group, you must have either the `logs:TagResource` or `logs:TagLogGroup` permission. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html). For more information about using tags to control access, see [Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html).
