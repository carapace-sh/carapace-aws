            Creates a new schema in a development state. A schema can exist in three phases:

            - *Development:* This is a mutable phase of the schema. All new schemas are in the development phase. Once the schema is finalized, it can be published.
            - *Published:* Published schemas are immutable and have a version associated with them.
            - *Applied:* Applied schemas are mutable in a way that allows you to add new schema facets. You can also add new, nonrequired attributes to existing schema facets. You can apply only published schemas to directories.
