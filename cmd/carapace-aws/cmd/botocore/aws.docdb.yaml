            kms-key-id: |-
                The KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted cluster from an encrypted cluster.

                The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same Amazon Web Services account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

                You can restore to a new cluster and encrypt the new cluster with an KMS key that is different from the KMS key used to encrypt the source cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS key identified by the `KmsKeyId` parameter.

                If you do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

                - If the cluster is encrypted, then the restored cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source cluster.
                - If the cluster is not encrypted, then the restored cluster is not encrypted.

                If `DBClusterIdentifier` refers to a cluster that is not encrypted, then the restore request is rejected.
            network-type: |-
                The network type of the cluster.

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the cluster. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [DocumentDB clusters in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/vpc-clusters.html) in the Amazon DocumentDB Developer Guide.

                The port number on which the new cluster accepts connections.

                Constraints: Must be a value from `1150` to `65535`.

                Default: The default port for the engine.
            restore-to-time: |-
                The date and time to restore the cluster to.

                Valid values: A time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format.

                Constraints:

                - Cannot be specified if the `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter is `true`.
                - Cannot be specified if the `RestoreType` parameter is `copy-on-write`.

                Example: `2015-03-07T23:45:00Z`
            restore-type: |-
                The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:

                - `full-copy` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.
                - `copy-on-write` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster.

                Constraints: You can't specify `copy-on-write` if the engine version of the source DB cluster is earlier than 1.11.

                If you don't specify a `RestoreType` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.

                The KMS key ID for an encrypted cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

                If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services account, you can specify a value for `KmsKeyId` to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for `KmsKeyId`, then the copy of the cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source cluster snapshot.

                If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot that is shared from another Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for `KmsKeyId`.

                To copy an encrypted cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services Region, set `KmsKeyId` to the KMS key ID that you want to use to encrypt the copy of the cluster snapshot in the destination Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

            pre-signed-url: |-
                The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the`CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API action in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source cluster snapshot to copy. You must use the `PreSignedUrl` parameter when copying a cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region.

                If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

                The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the cluster snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

                - `SourceRegion` - The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.
                - `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the the encrypted cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted cluster snapshot from the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` looks something like the following: `arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345678012:sample-cluster:sample-cluster-snapshot`.
                - `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the new cluster snapshot to be created. This parameter isn't case sensitive.
            source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier: |-
                The identifier of the cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not case sensitive.

                Constraints:

                - Must specify a valid cluster snapshot in the *available* state.
                - If the source cluster snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the copy, specify a valid snapshot identifier.
                - If the source cluster snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Region or owned by another Amazon Web Services account, specify the snapshot ARN.

                Example: `my-cluster-snapshot1`
            tags: The tags to be assigned to the cluster snapshot.
            target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier: |-
                The identifier of the new cluster snapshot to create from the source cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

            db-instance-class: |-
                The new compute and memory capacity of the instance; for example, `db.r5.large`. Not all instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions.

                If you modify the instance class, an outage occurs during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless `ApplyImmediately` is specified as `true` for this request.

                Default: Uses existing setting.
            db-instance-identifier: |-
                The instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

                Constraints:

            new-db-instance-identifier: |-
                The new instance identifier for the instance when renaming an instance. When you change the instance identifier, an instance reboot occurs immediately if you set `Apply Immediately` to `true`. It occurs during the next maintenance window if you set `Apply Immediately` to `false`. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

                Constraints:

                - Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
                - The first character must be a letter.

                The KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

                The KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId, then Amazon DocumentDB uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services region.
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, changing this parameter causes a reboot of the instance. If you are moving this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure that pending changes are applied.

                Default: Uses existing setting.

                Format: `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`

                Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            snapshot-type: |-
                The type of cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

                - `automated` - Return all cluster snapshots that Amazon DocumentDB has automatically created for your Amazon Web Services account.
                - `manual` - Return all cluster snapshots that you have manually created for your Amazon Web Services account.
                - `shared` - Return all manual cluster snapshots that have been shared to your Amazon Web Services account.
                - `public` - Return all cluster snapshots that have been marked as public.

                If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and manual cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared cluster snapshots with these results by setting the `IncludeShared` parameter to `true`. You can include public cluster snapshots with these results by setting the`IncludePublic` parameter to `true`.

                The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `public`.

        command: Modifies a setting for an Amazon DocumentDB cluster. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request.
        flag:
            allow-major-version-upgrade: |-
                A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.

                Constraints:

                - You must allow major version upgrades when specifying a value for the `EngineVersion` parameter that is a different major version than the cluster's current version.
                - Since some parameters are version specific, changing them requires executing a new `ModifyDBCluster` API call after the in-place MVU completes.

                Performing an MVU directly impacts the following parameters:

                - `MasterUserPassword`
                - `NewDBClusterIdentifier`
                - `VpcSecurityGroupIds`
                - `Port`
            apply-immediately: |-
                A value that specifies whether the changes in this request and any pending changes are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` setting for the cluster. If this parameter is set to `false`, changes to the cluster are applied during the next maintenance window.

                The `ApplyImmediately` parameter affects only the `NewDBClusterIdentifier` and `MasterUserPassword` values. If you set this parameter value to `false`, the changes to the `NewDBClusterIdentifier` and `MasterUserPassword` values are applied during the next maintenance window. All other changes are applied immediately, regardless of the value of the `ApplyImmediately` parameter.

                Default: `false`
            backup-retention-period: |-
                The number of days for which automated backups are retained. You must specify a minimum value of 1.

                Default: 1

                Constraints:

                - Must be a value from 1 to 35.
            cli-input-json: |-

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration: The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for a specific instance or cluster. The `EnableLogTypes` and `DisableLogTypes` arrays determine which logs are exported (or not exported) to CloudWatch Logs.
            db-cluster-identifier: |-
                The cluster identifier for the cluster that is being modified. This parameter is not case sensitive.

                Constraints:

                - Must match the identifier of an existing `DBCluster`.
            db-cluster-parameter-group-name: The name of the cluster parameter group to use for the cluster.
            deletion-protection: Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If `DeletionProtection` is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified and `DeletionProtection` is disabled. `DeletionProtection` protects clusters from being accidentally deleted.
            engine-version: |-
                The version number of the database engine to which you want to upgrade. Changing this parameter results in an outage. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless `ApplyImmediately` is enabled.

                To list all of the available engine versions for Amazon DocumentDB use the following command:

                `aws docdb describe-db-engine-versions --engine docdb --query "DBEngineVersions[].EngineVersion"`
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            manage-master-user-password: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the cluster doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this case, you can't specify `MasterUserPassword`. If the cluster already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify `MasterUserPassword`. In this case, Amazon DocumentDB deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by `MasterUserPassword`.
            master-user-password: |-
                The password for the master database user. This password can contain any printable ASCII character except forward slash (/), double quote ("), or the "at" symbol (@).

                Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 100 characters.
            master-user-secret-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

                This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met:

                - The cluster doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the cluster already manages the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret.
                - You are enabling `ManageMasterUserPassword` to manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If you are turning on `ManageMasterUserPassword` and don't specify `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId`, then the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            network-type: |-
                The network type of the cluster.

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the cluster. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [DocumentDB clusters in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/vpc-clusters.html) in the Amazon DocumentDB Developer Guide.

                Valid Values: `IPV4` | `DUAL`
            new-db-cluster-identifier: |-

                The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                Format: `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`

                The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of the week.

                Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

                Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
            rotate-master-user-password: |-
                Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password.

                This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by Amazon DocumentDB in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the cluster. The secret value contains the updated password.

                Constraint: You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user password.
            serverless-v2-scaling-configuration: Contains the scaling configuration of an Amazon DocumentDB Serverless cluster.

            Creates an Amazon DocumentDB event notification subscription. This action requires a topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by using the Amazon DocumentDB console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the Amazon SNS console.

            You can specify the type of source (`SourceType`) that you want to be notified of. You can also provide a list of Amazon DocumentDB sources (`SourceIds`) that trigger the events, and you can provide a list of event categories (`EventCategories`) for events that you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify `SourceType = db-instance`, `SourceIds = mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2` and `EventCategories = Availability, Backup`.

            If you specify both the `SourceType` and `SourceIds` (such as `SourceType = db-instance` and `SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1`), you are notified of all the `db-instance` events for the specified source. If you specify a `SourceType` but do not specify a `SourceIdentifier`, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your Amazon DocumentDB sources. If you do not specify either the `SourceType` or the `SourceIdentifier`, you are notified of events generated from all Amazon DocumentDB sources belonging to your customer account.

            After you create a cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first cluster that uses that cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon DocumentDB to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new cluster. This step is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the `character_set_database` parameter.

            Creates a new cluster parameter group.

            Parameters in a cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a cluster.

            A cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the cluster. In Amazon DocumentDB, you cannot make modifications directly to the `default.docdb3.6` cluster parameter group. If your Amazon DocumentDB cluster is using the default cluster parameter group and you want to modify a value in it, you must first [create a new parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/cluster_parameter_group-create.html) or [copy an existing parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/cluster_parameter_group-copy.html), modify it, and then apply the modified parameter group to your cluster. For the new cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect, you must then reboot the instances in the cluster without failover. For more information, see [Modifying Amazon DocumentDB Cluster Parameter Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/cluster_parameter_group-modify.html).

            Creates an Amazon DocumentDB global cluster that can span multiple multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global cluster contains one primary cluster with read-write capability, and up-to 10 read-only secondary clusters. Global clusters uses storage-based fast replication across regions with latencies less than one second, using dedicated infrastructure with no impact to your workload’s performance.

            You can create a global cluster that is initially empty, and then add a primary and a secondary to it. Or you can specify an existing cluster during the create operation, and this cluster becomes the primary of the global cluster.

            This action only applies to Amazon DocumentDB clusters.

            marker: An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by `MaxRecords`.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-records: |-
                The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a pagination token (marker) is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

                Default: 100

                Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
