            Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified canary or group.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the `TagResource` action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a canary or group.

            Groups are global resources. When you create a group, it is replicated across Amazon Web Services Regions, and you can view it and add canaries to it from any Region. Although the group ARN format reflects the Region name where it was created, a group is not constrained to any Region. This means that you can put canaries from multiple Regions into the same group, and then use that group to view and manage all of those canaries in a single view.

            Groups are supported in all Regions except the Regions that are disabled by default. For more information about these Regions, see [Enabling a Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable).

            Each group can contain as many as 10 canaries. You can have as many as 20 groups in your account. Any single canary can be a member of up to 10 groups.

For more information, see [Visual monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsLogger_VisualTesting.html) and [Visual monitoring blueprint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Blueprints_VisualTesting.html)

                A list of visual reference configurations for the canary, one for each browser type that the canary is configured to run on. Visual references are used for visual monitoring comparisons.

                `syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0` and above, and `syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0` and above, only supports `visualReferences`. `visualReference` field is not supported.

                Versions older than `syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0` supports both `visualReference` and `visualReferences` for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use `visualReferences` for consistency and future compatibility.

                For multibrowser visual monitoring, you can update the baseline for all configured browsers in a single update call by specifying a list of VisualReference objects, one per browser. Each VisualReference object maps to a specific browser configuration, allowing you to manage visual baselines for multiple browsers simultaneously.

                For single configuration canaries using Chrome browser (default browser), use visualReferences for `syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0` and above, and `syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0` and above canaries. The browserType in the visualReference object is not mandatory.

            Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.

            Do not use `CreateCanary` to modify an existing canary. Use [UpdateCanary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html) instead.

            To create canaries, you must have the `CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess` policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the `iam:CreateRole`, `iam:CreatePolicy` and `iam:AttachRolePolicy` permissions. For more information, see [Necessary Roles and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles).

            Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet.

            This operation returns a list of the canaries in your account, along with full details about each canary.

            This operation supports resource-level authorization using an IAM policy and the `Names` parameter. If you specify the `Names` parameter, the operation is successful only if you have authorization to view all the canaries that you specify in your request. If you do not have permission to view any of the canaries, the request fails with a 403 response.

            You are required to use the `Names` parameter if you are logged on to a user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries that you are allowed to view. For more information, see [Limiting a user to viewing specific canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Restricted.html).
