            schedule-expression: |-
                The expression that defines when the schedule runs. The following formats are supported.

                - `at` expression - `at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)`
                - `rate` expression - `rate(value unit)`
                - `cron` expression - `cron(fields)`

                You can use `at` expressions to create one-time schedules that invoke a target once, at the time and in the time zone, that you specify. You can use `rate` and `cron` expressions to create recurring schedules. Rate-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target at regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes or every five days. Cron-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target periodically at a specific time, such as at 8:00 am (UTC+0) every 1st day of the month.

                A `cron` expression consists of six fields separated by white spaces: `(minutes hours day_of_month month day_of_week year)`.

                A `rate` expression consists of a *value* as a positive integer, and a *unit* with the following options: `minute` | `minutes` | `hour` | `hours` | `day` | `days`

            schedule-expression-timezone: The timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated.
            start-date: The date, in UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might occur on, or after, the `StartDate` you specify. EventBridge Scheduler ignores `StartDate` for one-time schedules.
            state: Specifies whether the schedule is enabled or disabled.
            target: The schedule's target.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Deletes the specified schedule group. Deleting a schedule group results in EventBridge Scheduler deleting all schedules associated with the group. When you delete a group, it remains in a `DELETING` state until all of its associated schedules are deleted. Schedules associated with the group that are set to run while the schedule group is in the process of being deleted might continue to invoke their targets until the schedule group and its associated schedules are deleted.

            This operation is eventually consistent.

                A `rate` expression consists of a *value* as a positive integer, and a *unit* with the following options: `minute` | `minutes` | `hour` | `hours` | `day` | `days`

                For more information and examples, see [Schedule types on EventBridge Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/schedule-types.html) in the *EventBridge Scheduler User Guide*.
            schedule-expression-timezone: The timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated.
            start-date: The date, in UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might occur on, or after, the `StartDate` you specify. EventBridge Scheduler ignores `StartDate` for one-time schedules.
            state: Specifies whether the schedule is enabled or disabled.
            target: The schedule target. You can use this operation to change the target that your schedule invokes.
