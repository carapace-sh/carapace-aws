            Lists the created artifacts attached to a given migration task in an update stream. This API has the following traits:

            - Gets the list of the created artifacts while migration is taking place.
            - Shows the artifacts created by the migration tool that was associated by the `AssociateCreatedArtifact` API.
            - Lists created artifacts in a paginated interface.

            Provides identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it can be associated in the Application Discovery Service repository. This association occurs asynchronously after `PutResourceAttributes` returns.

            - Keep in mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will override previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first called with a MAC address, but later, it is desired to *add* an IP address, it will then be required to call it with *both* the IP and MAC addresses to prevent overriding the MAC address.
            - Note the instructions regarding the special use case of the [`ResourceAttributeList`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#migrationhub-PutResourceAttributes-request-ResourceAttributeList) parameter when specifying any "VM" related value.

            Because this is an asynchronous call, it will always return 200, whether an association occurs or not. To confirm if an association was found based on the provided details, call `ListDiscoveredResources`.

                - If any "VM" related value is set for a `ResourceAttribute` object, it is required that `VM_MANAGER_ID`, as a minimum, is always set. If `VM_MANAGER_ID` is not set, then all "VM" fields will be discarded and "VM" fields will not be used for matching the migration task to a server in Application Discovery Service repository. See the [Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#API_PutResourceAttributes_Examples) section below for a use case of specifying "VM" related values.
                - If a server you are trying to match has multiple IP or MAC addresses, you should provide as many as you know in separate type/value pairs passed to the `ResourceAttributeList` parameter to maximize the chances of matching.

            - Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted, `CreateProgressUpdateStream` for a stream of the same name will succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource (without any resources associated with the old stream).

        The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

        Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs, or a `HomeRegionNotSetException` error will be returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.
