        command: Synthesizes UTF-8 input, plain text or SSML, to a stream of bytes. SSML input must be valid, well-formed SSML. Some alphabets might not be available with all the voices (for example, Cyrillic might not be read at all by English voices) unless phoneme mapping is used.

            engine: Specifies the engine (`standard`, `neural`, `long-form`, or `generative`) for Amazon Polly to use when processing input text for speech synthesis. Provide an engine that is supported by the voice you select. If you don't provide an engine, the standard engine is selected by default. If a chosen voice isn't supported by the standard engine, this will result in an error. For information on Amazon Polly voices and which voices are available for each engine, see [Available Voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html).
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            language-code: |-
                Optional language code for the Synthesize Speech request. This is only necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN).

                If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly uses the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned by the [DescribeVoices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html) operation for the `LanguageCode` parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use Indian English rather than Hindi.
            lexicon-names: List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want the service to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the language of the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice. For information about storing lexicons, see [PutLexicon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_PutLexicon.html).
            output-format: |-
                The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio stream, this will be mp3, ogg\_vorbis, or pcm. For speech marks, this will be json.

                When pcm is used, the content returned is audio/pcm in a signed 16-bit, 1 channel (mono), little-endian format.
            sample-rate: |-
                The audio frequency specified in Hz.

                The valid values for mp3 and ogg\_vorbis are "8000", "16000", "22050", "24000", "44100" and "48000". The default value for standard voices is "22050". The default value for neural voices is "24000". The default value for long-form voices is "24000". The default value for generative voices is "24000".

                Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is "16000".
            speech-mark-types: The type of speech marks returned for the input text.
            text: Input text to synthesize. If you specify `ssml` as the `TextType`, follow the SSML format for the input text.
            text-type: Specifies whether the input text is plain text or SSML. The default value is plain text. For more information, see [Using SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html).
            voice-id: Voice ID to use for the synthesis. You can get a list of available voice IDs by calling the [DescribeVoices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html) operation.

            Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name.

            When synthesizing speech ( `SynthesizeSpeech` ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by `DescribeVoices`.

            For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the `DescribeVoices` operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.

            You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify `en-US`, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices.

            This operation requires permissions to perform the `polly:DescribeVoices` action.

      documentation:
        command: Allows the creation of an asynchronous synthesis task, by starting a new `SpeechSynthesisTask`. This operation requires all the standard information needed for speech synthesis, plus the name of an Amazon S3 bucket for the service to store the output of the synthesis task and two optional parameters (`OutputS3KeyPrefix` and `SnsTopicArn`). Once the synthesis task is created, this operation will return a `SpeechSynthesisTask` object, which will include an identifier of this task as well as the current status. The `SpeechSynthesisTask` object is available for 72 hours after starting the asynchronous synthesis task.

                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.

            engine: Specifies the engine (`standard`, `neural`, `long-form` or `generative`) for Amazon Polly to use when processing input text for speech synthesis. Using a voice that is not supported for the engine selected will result in an error.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            language-code: |-
                Optional language code for the Speech Synthesis request. This is only necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN).

                If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly uses the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned by the [DescribeVoices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html) operation for the `LanguageCode` parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use Indian English rather than Hindi.
            lexicon-names: List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want the service to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the language of the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice.
            output-format: The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio stream, this will be mp3, ogg\_vorbis, or pcm. For speech marks, this will be json.
            output-s3-bucket-name: Amazon S3 bucket name to which the output file will be saved.
            output-s3-key-prefix: The Amazon S3 key prefix for the output speech file.
            sample-rate: |-
                The audio frequency specified in Hz.

                The valid values for mp3 and ogg\_vorbis are "8000", "16000", "22050", and "24000". The default value for standard voices is "22050". The default value for neural voices is "24000". The default value for long-form voices is "24000". The default value for generative voices is "24000".

                Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is "16000".
            sns-topic-arn: ARN for the SNS topic optionally used for providing status notification for a speech synthesis task.
            speech-mark-types: The type of speech marks returned for the input text.
            text: The input text to synthesize. If you specify ssml as the TextType, follow the SSML format for the input text.
            text-type: Specifies whether the input text is plain text or SSML. The default value is plain text.
            voice-id: Voice ID to use for the synthesis.
documentation:
    command: |-
        Amazon Polly is a web service that makes it easy to synthesize speech from text.

        The Amazon Polly service provides API operations for synthesizing high-quality speech from plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), along with managing pronunciations lexicons that enable you to get the best results for your application domain.
