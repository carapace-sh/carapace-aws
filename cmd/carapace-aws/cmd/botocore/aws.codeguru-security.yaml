                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return in the response. Use this parameter when paginating results. If additional results exist beyond the number you specify, the `nextToken` element is returned in the response. Use `nextToken` in a subsequent request to retrieve additional results. If not specified, returns 1000 results.
            next-token: A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response. Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request. For subsequent calls, use the `nextToken` value returned from the previous request to continue listing results after the first page.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return in the response. Use this parameter when paginating results. If additional results exist beyond the number you specify, the `nextToken` element is returned in the response. Use `nextToken` in a subsequent request to retrieve additional results. If not specified, returns 100 results.
            next-token: A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response. Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request. For subsequent calls, use the `nextToken` value returned from the previous request to continue listing results after the first page.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

        On November 20, 2025, AWS will discontinue support for Amazon CodeGuru Security. After November 20, 2025, you will no longer be able to access the /codeguru/security console, service resources, or documentation. For more information, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/security-ug/end-of-support.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/security-ug/end-of-support.html).

        This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Security API operations. CodeGuru Security is a service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect security policy violations and vulnerabilities, and recommends ways to address these security risks.

        By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing security risks, CodeGuru Security improves the overall security of your application code. For more information about CodeGuru Security, see the [Amazon CodeGuru Security User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/security-ug/what-is-codeguru-security.html).
