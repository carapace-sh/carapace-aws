                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

            When you use identity-enhanced role sessions to list statements, you must provide either the `cluster-identifier` or `workgroup-name` parameter. This ensures that the IdC user can only access the Amazon Redshift IdC applications they are assigned.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of SQL statements to return in the response. If more SQL statements exist than fit in one response, then `NextToken` is returned to page through the results.
            next-token: A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned NextToken value in the next NextToken parameter and retrying the command. If the NextToken field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            role-level: A value that filters which statements to return in the response. If true, all statements run by the caller's IAM role are returned. If false, only statements run by the caller's IAM role in the current IAM session are returned. The default is true.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            statement-name: The name of the SQL statement specified as input to `BatchExecuteStatement` or `ExecuteStatement` to identify the query. You can list multiple statements by providing a prefix that matches the beginning of the statement name. For example, to list myStatement1, myStatement2, myStatement3, and so on, then provide the a value of `myStatement`. Data API does a case-sensitive match of SQL statement names to the prefix value you provide.
            status: |-
                The status of the SQL statement to list. Status values are defined as follows:

                - ABORTED - The query run was stopped by the user.
                - ALL - A status value that includes all query statuses. This value can be used to filter results.
                - FAILED - The query run failed.
                - FINISHED - The query has finished running.
                - PICKED - The query has been chosen to be run.
                - STARTED - The query run has started.
                - SUBMITTED - The query was submitted, but not yet processed.
            workgroup-name: The serverless workgroup name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Only statements that ran on this workgroup are returned. When providing `WorkgroupName`, then `ClusterIdentifier` can't be specified.
