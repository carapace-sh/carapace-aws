            A keyword is a word that you can search for on a particular phone number or pool. It is also a specific word or phrase that an end user can send to your number to elicit a response, such as an informational message or a special offer. When your number receives a message that begins with a keyword, End User MessagingSMS responds with a customizable message.

            If you specify a keyword that isn't valid, an error is returned.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return per each request.
            next-token: The token to be used for the next set of paginated results. You don't need to supply a value for this field in the initial request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            A keyword is a word that you can search for on a particular phone number or pool. It is also a specific word or phrase that an end user can send to your number to elicit a response, such as an informational message or a special offer. When your number receives a message that begins with a keyword, End User MessagingSMS responds with a customizable message.

            Creates a new event destination in a configuration set.

            An event destination is a location where you send message events. The event options are Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Data Firehose, or Amazon SNS. For example, when a message is delivered successfully, you can send information about that event to an event destination, or send notifications to endpoints that are subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

            You can only create one event destination at a time. You must provide a value for a single event destination using either `CloudWatchLogsDestination`, `KinesisFirehoseDestination` or `SnsDestination`. If an event destination isn't provided then an exception is returned.

            Each configuration set can contain between 0 and 5 event destinations. Each event destination can contain a reference to a single destination, such as a CloudWatch or Firehose destination.

            An opt-out list is a list of phone numbers that are opted out, meaning you can't send SMS or voice messages to them. If end user replies with the keyword "STOP," an entry for the phone number is added to the opt-out list. In addition to STOP, your recipients can use any supported opt-out keyword, such as CANCEL or OPTOUT.
