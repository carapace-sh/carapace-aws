        command: |-
            Delete an OpsItem. You must have permission in Identity and Access Management (IAM) to delete an OpsItem.

            Note the following important information about this operation.

            - Deleting an OpsItem is irreversible. You can't restore a deleted OpsItem.
            - This operation uses an *eventual consistency model*, which means the system can take a few minutes to complete this operation. If you delete an OpsItem and immediately call, for example, [GetOpsItem](), the deleted OpsItem might still appear in the response.
            - This operation is idempotent. The system doesn't throw an exception if you repeatedly call this operation for the same OpsItem. If the first call is successful, all additional calls return the same successful response as the first call.
            - This operation doesn't support cross-account calls. A delegated administrator or management account can't delete OpsItems in other accounts, even if OpsCenter has been set up for cross-account administration. For more information about cross-account administration, see [Setting up OpsCenter to centrally manage OpsItems across accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-setting-up-cross-account.html) in the *Systems Manager User Guide*.

Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager tools. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises machines using Systems Manager, see [Using Amazon Web Services Systems Manager in hybrid and multicloud environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-hybrid-multicloud.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

                - `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
                - `Key=Environment,Value=Production`

                When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and VMs, you specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to the on-premises servers or VMs.

                You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You can tag your on-premises servers, edge devices, and VMs after they connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed node ID. This means they are listed in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with "mi-". For information about how to add tags to your managed nodes, see [AddTagsToResource](). For information about how to remove tags from your managed nodes, see [RemoveTagsFromResource]().

If no appropriate service-linked role for Systems Manager exists in your account, it is created when you run `RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow`.

                However, for an improved security posture, we strongly recommend creating a custom policy and custom service role for running your maintenance window tasks. The policy can be crafted to provide only the permissions needed for your particular maintenance window tasks.

                The data type for a `String` parameter. Supported data types include plain text and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs.

                **The following data type values are supported.**

                - `text`
                - `aws:ec2:image`
                - `aws:ssm:integration`

                When you create a `String` parameter and specify `aws:ec2:image`, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager validates the parameter value is in the required format, such as `ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE`, and that the specified AMI is available in your Amazon Web Services account.

                If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response which indicates a successful `PutParameter` call for all cases except for data type `aws:ec2:image`. If you call `PutParameter` with `aws:ec2:image` data type, a successful HTTP 200 response does not guarantee that your parameter was successfully created or updated. The `aws:ec2:image` value is validated asynchronously, and the `PutParameter` call returns before the validation is complete. If you submit an invalid AMI value, the PutParameter operation will return success, but the asynchronous validation will fail and the parameter will not be created or updated. To monitor whether your `aws:ec2:image` parameters are created successfully, see [Setting up notifications or trigger actions based on Parameter Store events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-cwe.html). For more information about AMI format validation , see [Native parameter support for Amazon Machine Image IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-ec2-aliases.html).

                If you don't specify a key ID, the system uses the default key associated with your Amazon Web Services account, which is not as secure as using a custom key.

                - To use a custom KMS key, choose the `SecureString` data type with the `Key ID` parameter.
            name: "The fully qualified name of the parameter that you want to create or update.\n\nYou can't enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a parameter, only the parameter name itself.\n\nThe fully qualified name includes the complete hierarchy of the parameter path and name. For parameters in a hierarchy, you must include a leading forward slash character (/) when you create or reference a parameter. For example: `/Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13`\n\nNaming Constraints:\n\n- Parameter names are case sensitive.\n- A parameter name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region\n- A parameter name can't be prefixed with \"`aws`\" or \"`ssm`\" (case-insensitive).\n- Parameter names can include only the following symbols and letters: `a-zA-Z0-9_.-`\n  \n  In addition, the slash character ( / ) is used to delineate hierarchies in parameter names. For example: `/Dev/Production/East/Project-ABC/MyParameter`\n- Parameter names can't contain spaces. The service removes any spaces specified for the beginning or end of a parameter name. If the specified name for a parameter contains spaces between characters, the request fails with a `ValidationException` error.\n- Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen levels.\n\nFor additional information about valid values for parameter names, see [Creating Systems Manager parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-create.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.\n\nThe reported maximum length of 2048 characters for a parameter name includes 1037 characters that are reserved for internal use by Systems Manager. The maximum length for a parameter name that you specify is 1011 characters.\n\nThis count of 1011 characters includes the characters in the ARN that precede the name you specify. This ARN length will vary depending on your partition and Region. For example, the following 45 characters count toward the 1011 character maximum for a parameter created in the US East (Ohio) Region: `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:parameter/`."
            overwrite: Overwrite an existing parameter. The default value is `false`.
            policies: |-
                One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This operation takes a JSON array. Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager supports the following policy types:

                Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When you create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can update the expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating the *parameter* doesn't affect the expiration date and time. When the expiration time is reached, Parameter Store deletes the parameter.

                ExpirationNotification: This policy initiates an event in Amazon CloudWatch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using this policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time is reached, in units of days or hours.

                NoChangeNotification: This policy initiates a CloudWatch Events event if a parameter hasn't been modified for a specified period of time. This policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period of time, but it hasn't been changed.

                All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see [Assigning parameter policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-policies.html).
            tags: |-
                Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a Systems Manager parameter to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the parameter. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

                - `Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket`
                - `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
                - `Key=ParameterType,Value=LicenseKey`

                To add tags to an existing Systems Manager parameter, use the [AddTagsToResource]() operation.
            tier: "The parameter tier to assign to a parameter.\n\nParameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost.\n\nAdvanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see [Managing parameter tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.\n\nYou can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters.\n\nIf you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter.\n\n**Using the Default Tier Configuration**\n\nIn `PutParameter` requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you don't specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration.\n\nThe default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:\n\n- **Advanced**: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters.\n- **Intelligent-Tiering**: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced.\n  \n  If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier.\n  \n  This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary.\n\nOptions that require an advanced parameter include the following:\n\n- The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.\n- The parameter uses a parameter policy.\n- More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.\n\nFor more information about configuring the default tier option, see [Specifying a default parameter tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html#ps-default-tier) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*."
            type: |-
                The type of parameter that you want to create.

                `SecureString` isn't currently supported for CloudFormation templates.

                Items in a `StringList` must be separated by a comma (,). You can't use other punctuation or special character to escape items in the list. If you have a parameter value that requires a comma, then use the `String` data type.

                Specifying a parameter type isn't required when updating a parameter. You must specify a parameter type when creating a parameter.
            value: |-
                The parameter value that you want to add to the system. Standard parameters have a value limit of 4 KB. Advanced parameters have a value limit of 8 KB.

                Parameters can't be referenced or nested in the values of other parameters. You can't include values wrapped in double brackets `{{}}` or `{{ssm:parameter-name}}` in a parameter value.

            `ServiceSetting` is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.

            Services map a `SettingId` object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a `SettingId`. You can't create a new `SettingId`, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the `ssm:UpdateServiceSetting` permission for the setting. Use the [GetServiceSetting]() API operation to view the current value. Use the [UpdateServiceSetting]() API operation to change the default setting.

        command: A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your managed nodes. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your managed nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service.

            compliance-severity: The severity level to assign to the association.
            document-version: |-
                The document version you want to associate with the targets. Can be a specific version or the default version.

                State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the `default` version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to `default`.
            duration: |-
                The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled. Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken offline for the association to run, it is made available again immediately, without a reboot.

                The `Duration` parameter applies only when both these conditions are true:

                - The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation runbook associated with this execution.
                - The command specifies the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is created, but only according to the specified schedule.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            instance-id: |-
                The managed node ID.

                `InstanceId` has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for an association, use the `Targets` parameter. Requests that include the parameter `InstanceID` with Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use the parameter `InstanceId`, you can't use the parameters `AssociationName`, `DocumentVersion`, `MaxErrors`, `MaxConcurrency`, `OutputLocation`, or `ScheduleExpression`. To use these parameters, you must use the `Targets` parameter.
            max-concurrency: |-
                The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time.

                If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running `MaxConcurrency` associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for `MaxConcurrency`.
            max-errors: |-
                The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set `MaxError` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors` is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
            name: |-
                The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node.

                You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another Amazon Web Services account.

                For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:

                `arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name`

                For example:

                `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document`

                For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` or `My-Document`.
            output-location: An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to store the output details of the request.
            parameters: The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.
            schedule-expression: A cron expression when the association will be applied to the targets.
            schedule-offset: |-
                Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of `cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *)`, you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see [Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                To use offsets, you must specify the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.
            sync-compliance: |-
                The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify `AUTO` or `MANUAL`. In `AUTO` mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is `COMPLIANT`. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.

                In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a parameter for the [PutComplianceItems]() API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the [PutComplianceItems]() API operation.

                By default, all associations use `AUTO` mode.
            tags: Adds or overwrites one or more tags for a State Manager association. *Tags* are metadata that you can assign to your Amazon Web Services resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
            target-locations: |-
                A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use this action to create an association in multiple Regions and multiple accounts.

                The `IncludeChildOrganizationUnits` parameter is not supported by State Manager.
            target-maps: A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.
            targets: The targets for the association. You can target managed nodes by using tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node IDs. You can target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by specifying the `InstanceIds` key with a value of `*`. For more information about choosing targets for an association, see [Understanding targets and rate controls in State Manager associations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state-manager-targets-and-rate-controls.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            instance-ids: |-
                The IDs of the managed nodes where the command should run. Specifying managed node IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited number of managed nodes, though you can specify up to 50 IDs.

                To target a larger number of managed nodes, or if you prefer not to list individual node IDs, we recommend using the `Targets` option instead. Using `Targets`, which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify the managed nodes to send commands to, you can a send command to tens, hundreds, or thousands of nodes at once.

                For more information about how to use targets, see [Run commands at scale](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
            max-concurrency: (Optional) The maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed to run the command at the same time. You can specify a number such as 10 or a percentage such as 10%. The default value is `50`. For more information about how to use `MaxConcurrency`, see [Using concurrency controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-velocity) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
            max-errors: The maximum number of errors allowed without the command failing. When the command fails one more time beyond the value of `MaxErrors`, the systems stops sending the command to additional targets. You can specify a number like 10 or a percentage like 10%. The default value is `0`. For more information about how to use `MaxErrors`, see [Using error controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-maxerrors) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
            notification-config: Configurations for sending notifications.
            output-s3-bucket-name: The name of the S3 bucket where command execution responses should be stored.
            output-s3-key-prefix: The directory structure within the S3 bucket where the responses should be stored.
            output-s3-region: (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter. The system ignores it. Instead, Systems Manager automatically determines the Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.
            parameters: The required and optional parameters specified in the document being run.
            service-role-arn: |-
                The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role to use to publish Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications for Run Command commands.

                This role must provide the `sns:Publish` permission for your notification topic. For information about creating and using this service role, see [Monitoring Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitoring-sns-notifications.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
            targets: |-
                An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a `Key,Value` combination that you specify. Specifying targets is most useful when you want to send a command to a large number of managed nodes at once. Using `Targets`, which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify managed nodes, you can send a command to tens, hundreds, or thousands of nodes at once.

                To send a command to a smaller number of managed nodes, you can use the `InstanceIds` option instead.

                For more information about how to use targets, see [Run commands at scale](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                ALLOW\_AS\_DEPENDENCY

                **Linux and macOS**: A package in the rejected patches list is installed only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as `INSTALLED_OTHER`. This is the default action if no option is specified.

                **Windows Server**: Windows Server doesn't support the concept of package dependencies. If a package in the rejected patches list and already installed on the node, its status is reported as `INSTALLED_OTHER`. Any package not already installed on the node is skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.

                BLOCK

                **All OSs**: Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages that include them as dependencies, aren't installed by Patch Manager under any circumstances.

                State value assignment for patch compliance:

                - If a package was installed before it was added to the rejected patches list, or is installed outside of Patch Manager afterward, it's considered noncompliant with the patch baseline and its status is reported as `INSTALLED_REJECTED`.
                - If an update attempts to install a dependency package that is now rejected by the baseline, when previous versions of the package were not rejected, the package being updated is reported as `MISSING` for `SCAN` operations and as `FAILED` for `INSTALL` operations.

                OpsMetadata object: `ResourceID` for tagging is created from the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the object. Specifically, `ResourceID` is created from the strings that come after the word `opsmetadata` in the ARN. For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` has a `ResourceID` of either `aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` or `/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager`.

                For the Document and Parameter values, use the name of the resource.

                The `ManagedInstance` type for this API operation is only for on-premises managed nodes. Specify the name of the managed node in the following format: mi-ID\_number. For example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f.

            Updates an association. You can update the association name and version, the document version, schedule, parameters, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) output. When you call `UpdateAssociation`, the system removes all optional parameters from the request and overwrites the association with null values for those parameters. This is by design. You must specify all optional parameters in the call, even if you are not changing the parameters. This includes the `Name` parameter. Before calling this API action, we recommend that you call the [DescribeAssociation]() API operation and make a note of all optional parameters required for your `UpdateAssociation` call.

            In order to call this API operation, a user, group, or role must be granted permission to call the [DescribeAssociation]() API operation. If you don't have permission to call `DescribeAssociation`, then you receive the following error: `An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the UpdateAssociation operation: User: <user_arn> isn't authorized to perform: ssm:DescribeAssociation on resource: <resource_arn>`

            When you update an association, the association immediately runs against the specified targets. You can add the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` parameter to run the association during the next schedule run.
        flag:
            alarm-configuration: ""
            apply-only-at-cron-interval: |-
                By default, when you update an association, the system runs it immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule you specified. Specify `true` for `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` if you want the association to run only according to the schedule you specified.

                If you chose this option when you created an association and later you edit that association or you make changes to the Automation runbook or SSM document on which that association is based, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval. For example, if you chose the `Latest` version of an SSM document when you created an association and you edit the association by choosing a different document version on the Documents page, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval if you previously set `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` to `true`. If this option wasn't selected, State Manager immediately runs the association.

                For more information, see [Understanding when associations are applied to resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#state-manager-about-scheduling) and [About target updates with Automation runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#runbook-target-updates) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

                You can reset this parameter. To do so, specify the `no-apply-only-at-cron-interval` parameter when you update the association from the command line. This parameter forces the association to run immediately after updating it and according to the interval specified.
            association-id: The ID of the association you want to update.
            association-name: The name of the association that you want to update.
            association-version: This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You must specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to ensure that this request succeeds, either specify `$LATEST`, or omit this parameter.
            automation-target-parameter-name: Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
            calendar-names: The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

            compliance-severity: The severity level to assign to the association.
            document-version: |-
                The document version you want update for the association.

                State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the `default` version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to `default`.
            duration: |-
                The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled. Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken offline for the association to run, it is made available again immediately, without a reboot.

                The `Duration` parameter applies only when both these conditions are true:

                - The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation runbook associated with this execution.
                - The command specifies the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is updated, but only according to the specified schedule.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-concurrency: |-
                The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time.

                If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running `MaxConcurrency` associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for `MaxConcurrency`.
            max-errors: |-
                The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set `MaxError` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors` is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
            name: |-
                The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node.

                You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account.

                For Systems Manager document (SSM document) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:

                `arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name`

                For example:

                `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document`

                For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` or `My-Document`.
            output-location: An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.
            parameters: The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a parameter using Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, you can reference the parameter using `{{ssm:parameter-name}}`.
            schedule-expression: The cron expression used to schedule the association that you want to update.
            schedule-offset: |-
                Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of `cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *)`, you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see [Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                To use offsets, you must specify the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.
            sync-compliance: |-
                The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify `AUTO` or `MANUAL`. In `AUTO` mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is `COMPLIANT`. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.

                In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a parameter for the [PutComplianceItems]() API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the [PutComplianceItems]() API operation.

                By default, all associations use `AUTO` mode.
            target-locations: |-
                A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use this action to update an association in multiple Regions and multiple accounts.

                The `IncludeChildOrganizationUnits` parameter is not supported by State Manager.
            target-maps: A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.
            targets: The targets of the association.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            A parameter label is a user-defined alias to help you manage different versions of a parameter. When you modify a parameter, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager automatically saves a new version and increments the version number by one. A label can help you remember the purpose of a parameter when there are multiple versions.

            Parameter labels have the following requirements and restrictions.

            - A version of a parameter can have a maximum of 10 labels.
            - You can't attach the same label to different versions of the same parameter. For example, if version 1 has the label Production, then you can't attach Production to version 2.
            - You can move a label from one version of a parameter to another.
            - You can't create a label when you create a new parameter. You must attach a label to a specific version of a parameter.
            - If you no longer want to use a parameter label, then you can either delete it or move it to a different version of a parameter.
            - A label can have a maximum of 100 characters.
            - Labels can contain letters (case sensitive), numbers, periods (.), hyphens (-), or underscores (\_).
            - Labels can't begin with a number, "`aws`" or "`ssm`" (not case sensitive). If a label fails to meet these requirements, then the label isn't associated with a parameter and the system displays it in the list of InvalidLabels.
            - Parameter names can't contain spaces. The service removes any spaces specified for the beginning or end of a parameter name. If the specified name for a parameter contains spaces between characters, the request fails with a `ValidationException` error.

            Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. *Tags* are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example:

            - `Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin`
            - `Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin`
            - `Key=Owner,Value=Dev`
            - `Key=Stack,Value=Production`
            - `Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production`
            - `Key=Stack,Value=Test`

            Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of 5 tags.

            We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.

            For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see [Tag your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` has a `ResourceID` of either `aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` or `/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager`.

                For the `Document` and `Parameter` values, use the name of the resource. If you're tagging a shared document, you must use the full ARN of the document.

                `ManagedInstance`: `mi-012345abcde`

                The `ManagedInstance` type for this API operation is only for on-premises managed nodes. You must specify the name of the managed node in the following format: `mi-ID_number`. For example, `mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f`.

        command: |-
            A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Amazon Web Services Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: `SyncToDestination` and `SyncFromSource`.

            You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the `SyncToDestination` type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see [Creating a resource data sync for Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/inventory-create-resource-data-sync.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

            You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the `SyncFromSource` type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions or `EntireOrganization` by using Organizations. For more information, see [Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

            A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the [ListResourceDataSync]().

            By default, data isn't encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.

            requires: A list of SSM documents required by a document. This parameter is used exclusively by AppConfig. When a user creates an AppConfig configuration in an SSM document, the user must also specify a required document for validation purposes. In this case, an `ApplicationConfiguration` document requires an `ApplicationConfigurationSchema` document for validation purposes.

            tags: |-
                Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an SSM document to identify the types of targets or the environment where it will run. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

                - `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
                - `Key=Environment,Value=Production`

                To add tags to an existing SSM document, use the [AddTagsToResource]() operation.
            target-type: 'Specify a target type to define the kinds of resources the document can run on. For example, to run a document on EC2 instances, specify the following value: `/AWS::EC2::Instance`. If you specify a value of ''/'' the document can run on all types of resources. If you don''t specify a value, the document can''t run on any resources. For a list of valid resource types, see [Amazon Web Services resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.'
            version-name: An optional field specifying the version of the artifact you are creating with the document. For example, `Release12.1`. This value is unique across all versions of a document, and can't be changed.

                The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel. You can specify a number, such as 10, or a percentage, such as 10%. The default value is `10`.

                If both this parameter and the `TargetLocation:TargetsMaxConcurrency` are supplied, `TargetLocation:TargetsMaxConcurrency` takes precedence.
            max-errors: |-
                The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running the automation on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops running the automation when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops running the automation on additional targets after the first error result is returned. If you run an automation on 50 resources and set max-errors to 10%, then the system stops running the automation on additional targets when the sixth error is received.

            tags: |-
                Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can specify a maximum of five tags for an automation. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an automation to identify an environment or operating system. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

                - `Key=environment,Value=test`
                - `Key=OS,Value=Windows`

                The `Array Members` maximum value is reported as 1000. This number includes capacity reserved for internal operations. When calling the `StartAutomationExecution` action, you can specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can, however, use the [AddTagsToResource]() action to add up to a total of 50 tags to an existing automation configuration.
            target-locations: A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and/or Amazon Web Services accounts where you want to run the automation. Use this operation to start an automation in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions and multiple Amazon Web Services accounts.

            Retrieves the current snapshot for the patch baseline the managed node uses. This API is primarily used by the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` Systems Manager document (SSM document).

            If you run the command locally, such as with the Command Line Interface (CLI), the system attempts to use your local Amazon Web Services credentials and the operation fails. To avoid this, you can run the command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager console. Use Run Command, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, with an SSM document that enables you to target a managed node with a script or command. For example, run the command using the `AWS-RunShellScript` document or the `AWS-RunPowerShellScript` document.

            Request results are returned on a best-effort basis. If you specify `MaxResults` in the request, the response includes information up to the limit specified. The number of items returned, however, can be between zero and the value of `MaxResults`. If the service reaches an internal limit while processing the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point and a `NextToken`. You can specify the `NextToken` in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

            Parameter names can't contain spaces. The service removes any spaces specified for the beginning or end of a parameter name. If the specified name for a parameter contains spaces between characters, the request fails with a `ValidationException` error.

            If you change the KMS key alias for the KMS key used to encrypt a parameter, then you must also update the key alias the parameter uses to reference KMS. Otherwise, `DescribeParameters` retrieves whatever the original key alias was referencing.

If no appropriate service-linked role for Systems Manager exists in your account, it is created when you run `RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow`.

                However, for an improved security posture, we strongly recommend creating a custom policy and custom service role for running your maintenance window tasks. The policy can be crafted to provide only the permissions needed for your particular maintenance window tasks.

                You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the [DescribeOpsItems]() API operation) can view and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the [GetOpsItem]() API operation).

                Use the `/aws/resources` key in OperationalData to specify a related resource in the request. Use the `/aws/automations` key in OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem.

For information about parameter tiers, see [Managing parameter tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html). For information about changing an existing standard parameter to an advanced parameter, see [Changing a standard parameter to an advanced parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html#parameter-store-advanced-parameters-enabling).\n  \n  To share a `SecureString` parameter, it must be encrypted with a customer managed key, and you must share the key separately through Key Management Service. Amazon Web Services managed keys cannot be shared. Parameters encrypted with the default Amazon Web Services managed key can be updated to use a customer managed key instead. For KMS key definitions, see [KMS concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html) in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.\n  \n  While you can share a parameter using the Systems Manager `PutResourcePolicy` operation, we recommend using Resource Access Manager (RAM) instead. This is because using `PutResourcePolicy` requires the extra step of promoting the parameter to a standard RAM Resource Share using the RAM [PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.html) API operation. Otherwise, the parameter won't be returned by the Systems Manager [DescribeParameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeParameters.html) API operation using the `--shared` option.\n  \n  For more information, see [Sharing a parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-shared-parameters.html#share) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*"

            Request results are returned on a best-effort basis. If you specify `MaxResults` in the request, the response includes information up to the limit specified. The number of items returned, however, can be between zero and the value of `MaxResults`. If the service reaches an internal limit while processing the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point and a `NextToken`. You can specify the `NextToken` in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

            Parameter names can't contain spaces. The service removes any spaces specified for the beginning or end of a parameter name. If the specified name for a parameter contains spaces between characters, the request fails with a `ValidationException` error.

            `ServiceSetting` is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of `false`. This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to `true` and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.

            Services map a `SettingId` object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a `SettingId`. You can't create a new `SettingId`, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the `ssm:UpdateServiceSetting` permission for the setting. Use the [UpdateServiceSetting]() API operation to change the default setting. Or use the [ResetServiceSetting]() to change the value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services service team.

            Gets the state of a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager change calendar at the current time or a specified time. If you specify a time, `GetCalendarState` returns the state of the calendar at that specific time, and returns the next time that the change calendar state will transition. If you don't specify a time, `GetCalendarState` uses the current time. Change Calendar entries have two possible states: `OPEN` or `CLOSED`.

            If you specify more than one calendar in a request, the command returns the status of `OPEN` only if all calendars in the request are open. If one or more calendars in the request are closed, the status returned is `CLOSED`.

            Returns detailed information about command execution for an invocation or plugin. The Run Command API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. You should keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command.

            `GetCommandInvocation` only gives the execution status of a plugin in a document. To get the command execution status on a specific managed node, use [ListCommandInvocations](). To get the command execution status across managed nodes, use [ListCommands]().

                **Linux and macOS**: A package in the rejected patches list is installed only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as `INSTALLED_OTHER`. This is the default action if no option is specified.

                State value assignment for patch compliance:

                - If a package was installed before it was added to the rejected patches list, or is installed outside of Patch Manager afterward, it's considered noncompliant with the patch baseline and its status is reported as `INSTALLED_REJECTED`.

            targets: |-
                The targets to register with the maintenance window. In other words, the managed nodes to run commands on when the maintenance window runs.

                If a single maintenance window task is registered with multiple targets, its task invocations occur sequentially and not in parallel. If your task must run on multiple targets at the same time, register a task for each target individually and assign each task the same priority level.

                You can specify targets using managed node IDs, resource group names, or tags that have been applied to managed nodes.

                **Example 1**: Specify managed node IDs

                `Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>`

                **Example 2**: Use tag key-pairs applied to managed nodes

                `Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>`

                **Example 3**: Use tag-keys applied to managed nodes

                `Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>`

                **Example 4**: Use resource group names

                `Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>`

                **Example 5**: Use filters for resource group types

                `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>`

                For `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters`, specify resource types in the following format

                `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC`

                For more information about these examples formats, including the best use case for each one, see [Examples: Register targets with a maintenance window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-cli-tutorial-targets-examples.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

            Lists your resource data sync configurations. Includes information about the last time a sync attempted to start, the last sync status, and the last time a sync successfully completed.

            The number of sync configurations might be too large to return using a single call to `ListResourceDataSync`. You can limit the number of sync configurations returned by using the `MaxResults` parameter. To determine whether there are more sync configurations to list, check the value of `NextToken` in the output. If there are more sync configurations to list, you can request them by specifying the `NextToken` returned in the call to the parameter of a subsequent call.

                Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

                Operational data keys *can't* begin with the following: `amazon`, `aws`, `amzn`, `ssm`, `/amazon`, `/aws`, `/amzn`, `/ssm`.

                You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the [DescribeOpsItems]() API operation) can view and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the [GetOpsItem]() API operation).

                Use the `/aws/resources` key in OperationalData to specify a related resource in the request. Use the `/aws/automations` key in OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem.

        command: |-
            `ServiceSetting` is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.

            Services map a `SettingId` object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a `SettingId`. You can't create a new `SettingId`, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the `ssm:UpdateServiceSetting` permission for the setting. Use the [GetServiceSetting]() API operation to view the current value. Or, use the [ResetServiceSetting]() to change the value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services service team.

            Update the service setting for the account.

This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. You should keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command.

                instance-id: (Required) The ID of the managed node targeted by the command. A *managed node* can be an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, edge device, and on-premises server or VM in your hybrid environment that is configured for Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
                plugin-name: |-
                    The name of the step for which you want detailed results. If the document contains only one step, you can omit the name and details for that step. If the document contains more than one step, you must specify the name of the step for which you want to view details. Be sure to specify the name of the step, not the name of a plugin like `aws:RunShellScript`.

                    To find the `PluginName`, check the document content and find the name of the step you want details for. Alternatively, use [ListCommandInvocations]() with the `CommandId` and `Details` parameters. The `PluginName` is the `Name` attribute of the `CommandPlugin` object in the `CommandPlugins` list.
