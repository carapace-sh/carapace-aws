            group-id: The identifier for a group in the identity store.
            identity-store-id: The globally unique identifier for the identity store.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to be returned per request. This parameter is used in all `List` requests to specify how many results to return in one page.
            next-token: The pagination token used for the `ListUsers`, `ListGroups` and `ListGroupMemberships` API operations. This value is generated by the identity store service. It is returned in the API response if the total results are more than the size of one page. This token is also returned when it is used in the API request to search for the next page.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
