            Creates or updates a resource-based policy for an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. Use resource-based policies to grant permissions to other AWS accounts or services to access your workspace.

            Only Prometheus-compatible APIs can be used for workspace sharing. You can add non-Prometheus-compatible APIs to the policy, but they will be ignored. For more information, see [Prometheus-compatible APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference-Prometheus-Compatible-Apis.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide*.

            If your workspace uses customer-managed KMS keys for encryption, you must grant the principals in your resource-based policy access to those KMS keys. You can do this by creating KMS grants. For more information, see [CreateGrant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGrant.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference* and [Encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/encryption-at-rest-Amazon-Service-Prometheus.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide*.

                For example, if your initial request has `maxResults` of 10, and there are 12 workspaces to return, then your initial request will return 10 and a `nextToken`. Using the next token in a subsequent call will return the remaining 2 workspaces.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

        command: |-
            The `CreateScraper` operation creates a scraper to collect metrics. A scraper pulls metrics from Prometheus-compatible sources and sends them to your Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. You can configure scrapers to collect metrics from Amazon EKS clusters, Amazon MSK clusters, or from VPC-based sources that support DNS-based service discovery. Scrapers are flexible, and can be configured to control what metrics are collected, the frequency of collection, what transformations are applied to the metrics, and more.

            An IAM role will be created for you that Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus uses to access the metrics in your source. You must configure this role with a policy that allows it to scrape metrics from your source. For Amazon EKS sources, see [Configuring your Amazon EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-collector-how-to.html#AMP-collector-eks-setup) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide*.

            The `scrapeConfiguration` parameter contains the base-64 encoded YAML configuration for the scraper.

            When creating a scraper, the service creates a `Network Interface` in each **Availability Zone** that are passed into `CreateScraper` through subnets. These network interfaces are used to connect to your source within the VPC for scraping metrics.

            For more information about collectors, including what metrics are collected, and how to configure the scraper, see [Using an Amazon Web Services managed collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-collector-how-to.html) in the *Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide*.

                The token for the next set of items to return. You receive this token from a previous call, and use it to get the next page of results. The other parameters must be the same as the initial call.

                For example, if your initial request has `maxResults` of 10, and there are 12 rule groups namespaces to return, then your initial request will return 10 and a `nextToken`. Using the next token in a subsequent call will return the remaining 2 namespaces.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
