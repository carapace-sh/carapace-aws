                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The total number of items to return.
            next-token: If the previous response was truncated, you receive this token. Use it in your next request to receive the next set of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-by: The parameter by which to sort the results.
            sort-order: An optional value that specifies whether you want the results sorted in `Ascending` or `Descending` order.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            status-equals: A filter that retrieves only jobs with a specific status.
