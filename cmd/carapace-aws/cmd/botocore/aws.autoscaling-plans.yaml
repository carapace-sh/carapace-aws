            Deletes the specified scaling plan.

            Deleting a scaling plan deletes the underlying [ScalingInstruction]() for all of the scalable resources that are covered by the plan.

            If the plan has launched resources or has scaling activities in progress, you must delete those resources separately.

        AWS Auto Scaling

        Use AWS Auto Scaling to create scaling plans for your applications to automatically scale your scalable AWS resources.

        **API Summary**

        You can use the AWS Auto Scaling service API to accomplish the following tasks:

        - Create and manage scaling plans
        - Define target tracking scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources based on utilization
        - Scale Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups using predictive scaling and dynamic scaling to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity faster
        - Set minimum and maximum capacity limits
