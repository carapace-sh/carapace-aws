            Sends a cancel request for a specified task. You can cancel a task only if it's still in a `QUEUED` state. Tasks that are already running can't be cancelled.

            A task might still run if it's processed from the queue before the `CancelTask` operation changes the task's state.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.
