                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                Specifies the maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: Specifies a value for receiving additional results after you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            service-code: Specifies the service identifier. To find the service code value for an Amazon Web Services service, use the [ListServices]() operation.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                Specifies the maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: Specifies a value for receiving additional results after you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            service-code: Specifies the service identifier. To find the service code value for an Amazon Web Services service, use the [ListServices]() operation.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: Specifies a value for receiving additional results after you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            quota-applied-at-level: Filters the response to return applied quota values for the `ACCOUNT`, `RESOURCE`, or `ALL` levels. `ACCOUNT` is the default.
            quota-code: Specifies the quota identifier. To find the quota code for a specific quota, use the [ListServiceQuotas]() operation, and look for the `QuotaCode` response in the output for the quota you want.
            service-code: Specifies the service identifier. To find the service code value for an Amazon Web Services service, use the [ListServices]() operation.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
