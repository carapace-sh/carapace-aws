            Creates a guardrail to block topics and to implement safeguards for your generative AI applications.

            You can configure the following policies in a guardrail to avoid undesirable and harmful content, filter out denied topics and words, and remove sensitive information for privacy protection.

            - **Content filters** - Adjust filter strengths to block input prompts or model responses containing harmful content.
            - **Denied topics** - Define a set of topics that are undesirable in the context of your application. These topics will be blocked if detected in user queries or model responses.
            - **Word filters** - Configure filters to block undesirable words, phrases, and profanity. Such words can include offensive terms, competitor names etc.
            - **Sensitive information filters** - Block or mask sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or custom regex in user inputs and model responses.

            In addition to the above policies, you can also configure the messages to be returned to the user if a user input or model response is in violation of the policies defined in the guardrail.

                The expected result of the Automated Reasoning check. Valid values include: , TOO\_COMPLEX, and NO\_TRANSLATIONS.

                - `VALID` - The claims are true. The claims are implied by the premises and the Automated Reasoning policy. Given the Automated Reasoning policy and premises, it is not possible for these claims to be false. In other words, there are no alternative answers that are true that contradict the claims.
                - `INVALID` - The claims are false. The claims are not implied by the premises and Automated Reasoning policy. Furthermore, there exists different claims that are consistent with the premises and Automated Reasoning policy.
                - `SATISFIABLE` - The claims can be true or false. It depends on what assumptions are made for the claim to be implied from the premises and Automated Reasoning policy rules. In this situation, different assumptions can make input claims false and alternative claims true.
                - `IMPOSSIBLE` - Automated Reasoning can’t make a statement about the claims. This can happen if the premises are logically incorrect, or if there is a conflict within the Automated Reasoning policy itself.
                - `TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS` - Detected an ambiguity in the translation meant it would be unsound to continue with validity checking. Additional context or follow-up questions might be needed to get translation to succeed.
                - `TOO_COMPLEX` - The input contains too much information for Automated Reasoning to process within its latency limits.
                - `NO_TRANSLATIONS` - Identifies that some or all of the input prompt wasn't translated into logic. This can happen if the input isn't relevant to the Automated Reasoning policy, or if the policy doesn't have variables to model relevant input. If Automated Reasoning can't translate anything, you get a single `NO_TRANSLATIONS` finding. You might also see a `NO_TRANSLATIONS` (along with other findings) if some part of the validation isn't translated.

            Creates a new custom model in Amazon Bedrock. After the model is active, you can use it for inference.

            To use the model for inference, you must purchase Provisioned Throughput for it. You can't use On-demand inference with these custom models. For more information about Provisioned Throughput, see [Provisioned Throughput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-throughput.html).

            The model appears in `ListCustomModels` with a `customizationType` of `imported`. To track the status of the new model, you use the `GetCustomModel` API operation. The model can be in the following states:

            - `Creating` - Initial state during validation and registration
            - `Active` - Model is ready for use in inference
            - `Failed` - Creation process encountered an error

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-by: The field to sort the results by. The only supported value is `CreationTime`.

            Creates an Automated Reasoning policy for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. Automated Reasoning policies use mathematical techniques to detect hallucinations, suggest corrections, and highlight unstated assumptions in the responses of your GenAI application.

            To create a policy, you upload a source document that describes the rules that you're encoding. Automated Reasoning extracts important concepts from the source document that will become variables in the policy and infers policy rules.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
