            Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your VPCs. Resolver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the query logging configuration.

            To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use `AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig`. For more information, see [AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html).

            You can optionally use Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other Amazon Web Services accounts. The other accounts can then associate VPCs with the configuration. The query logs that Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the configuration.

            Deletes a query logging configuration. When you delete a configuration, Resolver stops logging DNS queries for all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with the configuration. This also applies if the query logging configuration is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, and the other accounts have associated VPCs with the shared configuration.

            Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. See [DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html).

            If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, you must stop sharing the configuration before you can delete a configuration. The accounts that you shared the configuration with can first disassociate VPCs that they associated with the configuration, but that's not necessary. If you stop sharing the configuration, those VPCs are automatically disassociated from the configuration.

            protocols: |-
                The protocols you want to use for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applicable for default inbound endpoints only.

                For a default inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

                - Do53 and DoH in combination.
                - Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.
                - Do53 alone.
                - DoH alone.
                - DoH-FIPS alone.
                - None, which is treated as Do53.

                For a delegation inbound endpoint you can use Do53 only.

                For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

                - Do53 and DoH in combination.
                - Do53 alone.
                - DoH alone.
                - None, which is treated as Do53.

                You can't change the protocol of an inbound endpoint directly from only Do53 to only DoH, or DoH-FIPS. This is to prevent a sudden disruption to incoming traffic that relies on Do53. To change the protocol from Do53 to DoH, or DoH-FIPS, you must first enable both Do53 and DoH, or Do53 and DoH-FIPS, to make sure that all incoming traffic has transferred to using the DoH protocol, or DoH-FIPS, and then remove the Do53.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of objects that you want Resolver to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Resolver provides a `NextToken` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

                When you request a list of objects, Resolver returns at most the number of objects specified in `MaxResults`. If more objects are available for retrieval, Resolver returns a `NextToken` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

                - Do53 and DoH in combination.
                - Do53 alone.
                - DoH alone.
                - None, which is treated as Do53.
            resolver-endpoint-type: For the endpoint type you can choose either IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack. A dual-stack endpoint means that it will resolve via both IPv4 and IPv6. This endpoint type is applied to all IP addresses.
            security-group-ids: |-
                The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC. The security group that you specify must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound Resolver endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound Resolver endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

                Some security group rules will cause your connection to be tracked. For outbound resolver endpoint, it can potentially impact the maximum queries per second from outbound endpoint to your target name server. For inbound resolver endpoint, it can bring down the overall maximum queries per second per IP address to as low as 1500. To avoid connection tracking caused by security group, see [Untracked connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connectionsl).

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                - By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly.
                - If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.

                This behavior is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS Firewall rule group association.
