            Retrieves the latest deployed configuration. This API may return empty configuration data if the client already has the latest version. For more information about this API action and to view example CLI commands that show how to use it with the [StartConfigurationSession]() API action, see [Retrieving the configuration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-retrieving-the-configuration) in the *AppConfig User Guide*.

            Note the following important information.

            - Each configuration token is only valid for one call to `GetLatestConfiguration`. The `GetLatestConfiguration` response includes a `NextPollConfigurationToken` that should always replace the token used for the just-completed call in preparation for the next one.
            - `GetLatestConfiguration` is a priced call. For more information, see [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/).
        flag:
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.

            configuration-token: |-
                Token describing the current state of the configuration session. To obtain a token, first call the [StartConfigurationSession]() API. Note that every call to `GetLatestConfiguration` will return a new `ConfigurationToken` (`NextPollConfigurationToken` in the response) and *must* be provided to subsequent `GetLatestConfiguration` API calls.

                This token should only be used once. To support long poll use cases, the token is valid for up to 24 hours. If a `GetLatestConfiguration` call uses an expired token, the system returns `BadRequestException`.
