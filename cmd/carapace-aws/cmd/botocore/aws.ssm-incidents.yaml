                Filters the timeline events based on the provided conditional values. You can filter timeline events with the following keys:

                - `eventReference`
                - `eventTime`
                - `eventType`

                Note the following when deciding how to use Filters:

                - If you don't specify a Filter, the response includes all timeline events.
                - If you specify more than one filter in a single request, the response returns timeline events that match all filters.
                - If you specify a filter with more than one value, the response returns timeline events that match any of the values provided.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

        Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed to help users mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their Amazon Web Services-hosted applications. An incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services.

        Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact, highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager automates response plans and enables responder team escalation.
