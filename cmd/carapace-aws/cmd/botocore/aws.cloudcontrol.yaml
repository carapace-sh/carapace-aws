                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a `NextToken` value that you can assign to the `NextToken` request parameter to get the next set of results.

                The default is `20`.
            next-token: If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining results, the response object's `NextToken` parameter value is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this action again and assign that token to the request object's `NextToken` parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous response object's `NextToken` parameter is set to `null`.

The necessary permissions for each event handler are defined in the `handlers` section of the [resource type definition schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-schema.html).

                If you do not specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

                For more information, see [Specifying credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations.html#resource-operations-permissions) in the *Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide*.

            You specify your resource property updates as a list of patch operations contained in a JSON patch document that adheres to the [*RFC 6902 - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch*](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) standard.

            For details on how Cloud Control API performs resource update operations, see [Updating a resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations-update.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide*.

            After you have initiated a resource update request, you can monitor the progress of your request by calling [GetResourceRequestStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceRequestStatus.html) using the `RequestToken` of the `ProgressEvent` returned by `UpdateResource`.

            For more information about the properties of a specific resource, refer to the related topic for the resource in the [Resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) in the *CloudFormation Users Guide*.

                A unique identifier to ensure the idempotency of the resource request. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency, so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distinguish between request retries and new resource requests. You might retry a resource request to ensure that it was successfully received.

                A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After that, a resource request with the same client token is treated as a new request.

                If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion in the request.

                For more information, see [Ensuring resource operation requests are unique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations.html#resource-operations-idempotency) in the *Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide*.

            identifier: |-
                The identifier for the resource.

                You can specify the primary identifier, or any secondary identifier defined for the resource type in its resource schema. You can only specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be specified as a string or JSON; secondary identifiers must be specified as JSON.

                For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that consists of multiple resource properties strung together), to specify the primary identifier as a string, list the property values *in the order they are specified* in the primary identifier definition, separated by `|`.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            client-token: |-
                A unique identifier to ensure the idempotency of the resource request. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency, so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distinguish between request retries and new resource requests. You might retry a resource request to ensure that it was successfully received.

                A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After that, a resource request with the same client token is treated as a new request.

                If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion in the request.

                For more information, see [Ensuring resource operation requests are unique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations.html#resource-operations-idempotency) in the *Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide*.
            desired-state: |-
                Structured data format representing the desired state of the resource, consisting of that resource's properties and their desired values.

                Cloud Control API currently supports JSON as a structured data format.

                Specify the desired state as one of the following:

                - A JSON blob
                - A local path containing the desired state in JSON data format

                For more information, see [Composing the desired state of the resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations-create.html#resource-operations-create-desiredstate) in the *Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide*.

                For more information about the properties of a specific resource, refer to the related topic for the resource in the [Resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) in the *CloudFormation Users Guide*.

                If you do not specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

            After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you can monitor the progress of your request by calling [GetResourceRequestStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceRequestStatus.html) using the `RequestToken` of the `ProgressEvent` returned by `DeleteResource`.
