            If the enabled control shows an `EnablementStatus` of SUCCEEDED, supply parameters that are different from the currently configured parameters. Otherwise, Amazon Web Services Control Tower will not accept the request.

            If the enabled control shows an `EnablementStatus` of FAILED, Amazon Web Services Control Tower updates the control to match any valid parameters that you supply.

            If the `DriftSummary` status for the control shows as `DRIFTED`, you cannot call this API. Instead, you can update the control by calling the `ResetEnabledControl` API. Alternatively, you can call `DisableControl` and then call `EnableControl` again. Also, you can run an extending governance operation to repair drift.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
