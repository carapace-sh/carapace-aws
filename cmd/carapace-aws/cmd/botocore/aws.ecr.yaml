            Retrieves an authorization token. An authorization token represents your IAM authentication credentials and can be used to access any Amazon ECR registry that your IAM principal has access to. The authorization token is valid for 12 hours.

            The `authorizationToken` returned is a base64 encoded string that can be decoded and used in a `docker login` command to authenticate to a registry. The CLI offers an `get-login-password` command that simplifies the login process.

                To apply a template to all repositories in your registry that don't have an associated creation template, you can use `ROOT` as the prefix.

                There is always an assumed `/` applied to the end of the prefix. If you specify `ecr-public` as the prefix, Amazon ECR treats that as `ecr-public/`. When using a pull through cache rule, the repository prefix you specify during rule creation is what you should specify as your repository creation template prefix as well.

            You can filter images based on whether or not they are tagged by using the `tagStatus` filter and specifying either `TAGGED`, `UNTAGGED` or `ANY`. For example, you can filter your results to return only `UNTAGGED` images and then pipe that result to a [BatchDeleteImage]() operation to delete them. Or, you can filter your results to return only `TAGGED` images to list all of the tags in your repository.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of repository results returned by `DescribeRepositoryCreationTemplatesRequest` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeRepositoryCreationTemplatesRequest` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeRepositoryCreationTemplatesRequest` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 1000. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeRepositoryCreationTemplatesRequest` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value, if applicable.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `DescribeRepositoryCreationTemplates` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            prefixes: The repository namespace prefixes associated with the repository creation templates to describe. If this value is not specified, all repository creation templates are returned.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Starting with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output of the `docker images` command shows the uncompressed image size. Therefore, Docker might return a larger image than the image shown in the Amazon Web Services Management Console.

            The new version of Amazon ECR *Basic Scanning* doesn't use the [ImageDetail$imageScanFindingsSummary]() and [ImageDetail$imageScanStatus]() attributes from the API response to return scan results. Use the [DescribeImageScanFindings]() API instead.

            Creates or updates the replication configuration for a registry. The existing replication configuration for a repository can be retrieved with the [DescribeRegistry]() API action. The first time the PutReplicationConfiguration API is called, a service-linked IAM role is created in your account for the replication process. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide*. For more information on the custom role for replication, see [Creating an IAM role for replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/replication-creation-templates.html#roles-creatingrole-user-console).

            When configuring cross-account replication, the destination account must grant the source account permission to replicate. This permission is controlled using a registry permissions policy. For more information, see [PutRegistryPolicy]().

                max-results: The maximum number of image scan results returned by `DescribeImageScanFindings` in paginated output.

                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                    If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                    This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
                image-ids: The list of imageIDs to be included.
                max-items: |-
                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-results: "The maximum number of repository results returned by `GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest` in\L paginated output. When this parameter is used, `GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest` only returns\L `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken`\L response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending\L another `GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest` request with the returned `nextToken`\L value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this\L parameter is not used, then `GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest` returns up to\L100 results and a `nextToken` value, if\L applicable. This option cannot be used when you specify images with `imageIds`."
                next-token: "The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated\L `GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest` request where `maxResults` was used and the\L results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the\L previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is\L `null` when there are no more results to return. This option cannot be used when you specify images with `imageIds`."
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                registry-id: The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that contains the repository. If you do not specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.
                repository-name: The name of the repository.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

        Amazon Elastic Container Registry

        Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.

        Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information, see [Amazon ECR endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
