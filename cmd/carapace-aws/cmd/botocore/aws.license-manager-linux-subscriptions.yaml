                An array of structures that you can use to filter the results to those that match one or more sets of key-value pairs that you specify. For example, you can filter by the name of `Subscription` with an optional operator to see subscriptions that match, partially match, or don't match a certain subscription's name.

                The valid names for this filter are:

                - `Subscription`

                The valid Operators for this filter are:

                - `contains`

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum items to return in a request.
            next-token: A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the nextToken from a previously truncated response.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            filters: |-
                An array of structures that you can use to filter the results by your specified criteria. For example, you can specify `Region` in the `Name`, with the `contains` operator to list all subscriptions that match a partial string in the `Value`, such as `us-west`.

                For each filter, you can specify one of the following values for the `Name` key to streamline results:

                - `AccountID`
                - `AmiID`
                - `DualSubscription`
                - `InstanceID`
                - `InstanceType`
                - `ProductCode`
                - `Region`
                - `Status`
                - `UsageOperation`

                For each filter, you can use one of the following `Operator` values to define the behavior of the filter:

                - `contains`
                - `equals`
                - `Notequal`
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum items to return in a request.
            next-token: A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the nextToken from a previously truncated response.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
