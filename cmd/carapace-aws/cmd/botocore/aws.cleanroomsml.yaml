            tags: |-
                The optional metadata that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                The optional metadata that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                The optional metadata that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
                - Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            training-input-mode: |-
                The input mode for accessing the training data. This parameter determines how the training data is made available to the training algorithm. Valid values are:

                - `File` - The training data is downloaded to the training instance and made available as files.
                - `FastFile` - The training data is streamed directly from Amazon S3 to the training algorithm, providing faster access for large datasets.
                - `Pipe` - The training data is streamed to the training algorithm using named pipes, which can improve performance for certain algorithms.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

            max-results: The maximum size of the results that is returned per call.

            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
