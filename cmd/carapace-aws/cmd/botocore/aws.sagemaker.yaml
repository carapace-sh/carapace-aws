      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates a model in SageMaker. In the request, you name the model and describe a primary container. For the primary container, you specify the Docker image that contains inference code, artifacts (from prior training), and a custom environment map that the inference code uses when you deploy the model for predictions.

            Use this API to create a model if you want to use SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job.

            To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the `CreateEndpointConfig` API, and then create an endpoint with the `CreateEndpoint` API. SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment.

            To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the `CreateTransformJob` API. SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location.

            In the request, you also provide an IAM role that SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other Amazon Web Services resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.

                - The instance types that the model package supports for transform jobs and real-time endpoints used for inference.
                - The input and output content formats that the model package supports for inference.
            model-approval-status: The approval status of the model.
            model-card: The model card associated with the model package. Since `ModelPackageModelCard` is tied to a model package, it is a specific usage of a model card and its schema is simplified compared to the schema of `ModelCard`. The `ModelPackageModelCard` schema does not include `model_package_details`, and `model_overview` is composed of the `model_creator` and `model_artifact` properties. For more information about the model package model card schema, see [Model package model card schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html#model-card-schema). For more information about the model card associated with the model package, see [View the Details of a Model Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html).

            To create a private workforce using Amazon Cognito, you must specify a Cognito user pool in `CognitoConfig`. You can also create an Amazon Cognito workforce using the Amazon SageMaker console.

            Replaces specific nodes within a SageMaker HyperPod cluster with new hardware. `BatchReplaceClusterNodes` terminates the specified instances and provisions new replacement instances with the same configuration but fresh hardware. The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance configuration remain the same.

            This operation is useful for recovering from hardware failures or persistent issues that cannot be resolved through a reboot.

            - **Data Loss Warning:** Replacing nodes destroys all instance volumes, including both root and secondary volumes. All data stored on these volumes will be permanently lost and cannot be recovered.
            - To safeguard your work, back up your data to Amazon S3 or an FSx for Lustre file system before invoking the API on a worker node group. This will help prevent any potential data loss from the instance root volume. For more information about backup, see [Use the backup script provided by SageMaker HyperPod](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-operate-cli-command.html#sagemaker-hyperpod-operate-cli-command-update-cluster-software-backup).
            - If you want to invoke this API on an existing cluster, you'll first need to patch the cluster by running the [UpdateClusterSoftware API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateClusterSoftware.html). For more information about patching a cluster, see [Update the SageMaker HyperPod platform software of a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-operate-cli-command.html#sagemaker-hyperpod-operate-cli-command-update-cluster-software).

For more information about how to control the update and traffic shifting process, see [Update models in production](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails.html).

            When SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to `Updating`. After updating the endpoint, it sets the status to `InService`. To check the status of an endpoint, use the [DescribeEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpoint.html) API.

            You must not delete an `EndpointConfig` in use by an endpoint that is live or while the `UpdateEndpoint` or `CreateEndpoint` operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new `EndpointConfig`.

            If you delete the `EndpointConfig` of an endpoint that is active or being created or updated you may lose visibility into the instance type the endpoint is using. The endpoint must be deleted in order to stop incurring charges.

                `FeatureName`s cannot be any of the following: `is_deleted`, `write_time`, `api_invocation_time`

                You can create up to 2,500 `FeatureDefinition`s per `FeatureGroup`.
            feature-group-name: |-
                The name of the `FeatureGroup`. The name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon Web Services account.

                The name:

                - Must start with an alphanumeric character.
                - Can only include alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. Spaces are not allowed.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            offline-store-config: |-
                Use this to configure an `OfflineFeatureStore`. This parameter allows you to specify:

                - The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location of an `OfflineStore`.
                - A configuration for an Amazon Web Services Glue or Amazon Web Services Hive data catalog.
                - An KMS encryption key to encrypt the Amazon S3 location used for `OfflineStore`. If KMS encryption key is not specified, by default we encrypt all data at rest using Amazon Web Services KMS key. By defining your [bucket-level key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html) for SSE, you can reduce Amazon Web Services KMS requests costs by up to 99 percent.
                - Format for the offline store table. Supported formats are Glue (Default) and [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/).

                To learn more about this parameter, see [OfflineStoreConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_OfflineStoreConfig.html).
            online-store-config: |-
                You can turn the `OnlineStore` on or off by specifying `True` for the `EnableOnlineStore` flag in `OnlineStoreConfig`.

                You can also include an Amazon Web Services KMS key ID (`KMSKeyId`) for at-rest encryption of the `OnlineStore`.

                The default value is `False`.
            record-identifier-feature-name: |-
                The name of the `Feature` whose value uniquely identifies a `Record` defined in the `FeatureStore`. Only the latest record per identifier value will be stored in the `OnlineStore`. `RecordIdentifierFeatureName` must be one of feature definitions' names.

                You use the `RecordIdentifierFeatureName` to access data in a `FeatureStore`.

                This name:

                - Must start with an alphanumeric character.
                - Can only contains alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores. Spaces are not allowed.

Based on available reserved capacity:\n  \n  - Training jobs are launched.\n  - Instance groups are provisioned.\n\n**Plan composition**\n\nA plan can consist of one or more Reserved Capacities, each defined by a specific instance type, quantity, Availability Zone, duration, and start and end times.

            Creates an Autopilot job also referred to as Autopilot experiment or AutoML job.

            An AutoML job in SageMaker AI is a fully automated process that allows you to build machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise. When initiating an AutoML job, you provide your data and optionally specify parameters tailored to your use case. SageMaker AI then automates the entire model development lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation. AutoML jobs are designed to simplify and accelerate the model building process by automating various tasks and exploring different combinations of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter values. The output of an AutoML job comprises one or more trained models ready for deployment and inference. Additionally, SageMaker AI AutoML jobs generate a candidate model leaderboard, allowing you to select the best-performing model for deployment.

            For more information about AutoML jobs, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html) in the SageMaker AI developer guide.

            We recommend using the new versions [CreateAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoMLJobV2.html) and [DescribeAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoMLJobV2.html), which offer backward compatibility.

            `CreateAutoMLJobV2` can manage tabular problem types identical to those of its previous version `CreateAutoMLJob`, as well as time-series forecasting, non-tabular problem types such as image or text classification, and text generation (LLMs fine-tuning).

            Find guidelines about how to migrate a `CreateAutoMLJob` to `CreateAutoMLJobV2` in [Migrate a CreateAutoMLJob to CreateAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development-create-experiment.html#autopilot-create-experiment-api-migrate-v1-v2).

            You can find the best-performing model after you run an AutoML job by calling [DescribeAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoMLJobV2.html) (recommended) or [DescribeAutoMLJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoMLJob.html).

            creation-time-after: |-
                A filter that returns nodes in a SageMaker HyperPod cluster created after the specified time. Timestamps are formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard.

                Acceptable formats include:

                - `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD` (UTC), for example, `2014-10-01T20:30:00.000Z`
                - `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD` (with offset), for example, `2014-10-01T12:30:00.000-08:00`
                - `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example, `2014-10-01`
                - Unix time in seconds, for example, `1412195400`. This is also referred to as Unix Epoch time and represents the number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.

                For more information about the timestamp format, see [Timestamp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp) in the *Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide*.
            creation-time-before: A filter that returns nodes in a SageMaker HyperPod cluster created before the specified time. The acceptable formats are the same as the timestamp formats for `CreationTimeAfter`. For more information about the timestamp format, see [Timestamp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp) in the *Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide*.

            include-node-logical-ids: Specifies whether to include nodes that are still being provisioned in the response. When set to true, the response includes all nodes regardless of their provisioning status. When set to `False` (default), only nodes with assigned `InstanceIds` are returned.
            instance-group-name-contains: A filter that returns the instance groups whose name contain a specified string.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.

                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of nodes to return in the response.
            next-token: If the result of the previous `ListClusterNodes` request was truncated, the response includes a `NextToken`. To retrieve the next set of cluster nodes, use the token in the next request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-by: The field by which to sort results. The default value is `CREATION_TIME`.
            sort-order: The sort order for results. The default value is `Ascending`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Creates a Git repository as a resource in your SageMaker AI account. You can associate the repository with notebook instances so that you can use Git source control for the notebooks you create. The Git repository is a resource in your SageMaker AI account, so it can be associated with more than one notebook instance, and it persists independently from the lifecycle of any notebook instances it is associated with.

            The repository can be hosted either in [Amazon Web Services CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html) or in any other Git repository.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of transform jobs to return in the response. The default value is `10`.
            name-contains: A string in the transform job name. This filter returns only transform jobs whose name contains the specified string.
            next-token: If the result of the previous `ListTransformJobs` request was truncated, the response includes a `NextToken`. To retrieve the next set of transform jobs, use the token in the next request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-by: The field to sort results by. The default is `CreationTime`.
            sort-order: The sort order for results. The default is `Descending`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            status-equals: A filter that retrieves only transform jobs with a specific status.

            Creates a *trial component*, which is a stage of a machine learning *trial*. A trial is composed of one or more trial components. A trial component can be used in multiple trials.

            Trial components include pre-processing jobs, training jobs, and batch transform jobs.

            When you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experiments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked, logged, and indexed. When you use the Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto), you must use the logging APIs provided by the SDK.

            You can add tags to a trial component and then use the [Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_Search.html) API to search for the tags.

            Starts a model compilation job. After the model has been compiled, Amazon SageMaker AI saves the resulting model artifacts to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify.

            If you choose to host your model using Amazon SageMaker AI hosting services, you can use the resulting model artifacts as part of the model. You can also use the artifacts with Amazon Web Services IoT Greengrass. In that case, deploy them as an ML resource.

            In the request body, you provide the following:

            - A name for the compilation job
            - Information about the input model artifacts
            - The output location for the compiled model and the device (target) that the model runs on
            - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker AI assumes to perform the model compilation job.

            You can also provide a `Tag` to track the model compilation job's resource use and costs. The response body contains the `CompilationJobArn` for the compiled job.

            input-config: Provides information about the location of input model artifacts, the name and shape of the expected data inputs, and the framework in which the model was trained.
            model-package-version-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a versioned model package. Provide either a `ModelPackageVersionArn` or an `InputConfig` object in the request syntax. The presence of both objects in the `CreateCompilationJob` request will return an exception.
            output-config: Provides information about the output location for the compiled model and the target device the model runs on.
            role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that enables Amazon SageMaker AI to perform tasks on your behalf.

                During model compilation, Amazon SageMaker AI needs your permission to:

                - Read input data from an S3 bucket
                - Write model artifacts to an S3 bucket
                - Write logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs
                - Publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch

                You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. To pass this role to Amazon SageMaker AI, the caller of this API must have the `iam:PassRole` permission. For more information, see [Amazon SageMaker AI Roles.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html)
            stopping-condition: Specifies a limit to how long a model compilation job can run. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker AI ends the compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs.
            tags: An array of key-value pairs. You can use tags to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html).
            vpc-config: A [VpcConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_VpcConfig.html) object that specifies the VPC that you want your compilation job to connect to. Control access to your models by configuring the VPC. For more information, see [Protect Compilation Jobs by Using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/neo-vpc.html).

        command: |-
            Creates an SageMaker AI notebook instance. A notebook instance is a machine learning (ML) compute instance running on a Jupyter notebook.

            In a `CreateNotebookInstance` request, specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. SageMaker AI launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance.

            SageMaker AI also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use SageMaker AI with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework.

            After receiving the request, SageMaker AI does the following:

            1. Creates a network interface in the SageMaker AI VPC.
            2. (Option) If you specified `SubnetId`, SageMaker AI creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, SageMaker AI attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.
            3. Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the SageMaker AI VPC. If you specified `SubnetId` of your VPC, SageMaker AI specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.

            After creating the notebook instance, SageMaker AI returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can't change the name of a notebook instance after you create it.

            After SageMaker AI creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating SageMaker AI endpoints, and validate hosted models.

            role-arn: |-
                When you send any requests to Amazon Web Services resources from the notebook instance, SageMaker AI assumes this role to perform tasks on your behalf. You must grant this role necessary permissions so SageMaker AI can perform these tasks. The policy must allow the SageMaker AI service principal (sagemaker.amazonaws.com) permissions to assume this role. For more information, see [SageMaker AI Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html).

                To be able to pass this role to SageMaker AI, the caller of this API must have the `iam:PassRole` permission.
            root-access: |-
                Whether root access is enabled or disabled for users of the notebook instance. The default value is `Enabled`.

                Lifecycle configurations need root access to be able to set up a notebook instance. Because of this, lifecycle configurations associated with a notebook instance always run with root access even if you disable root access for users.
            security-group-ids: The VPC security group IDs, in the form sg-xxxxxxxx. The security groups must be for the same VPC as specified in the subnet.
            subnet-id: The ID of the subnet in a VPC to which you would like to have a connectivity from your ML compute instance.
            tags: An array of key-value pairs. You can use tags to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html).
            volume-size-in-gb: The size, in GB, of the ML storage volume to attach to the notebook instance. The default value is 5 GB.

                A list of `MemberDefinition` objects that contains objects that identify the workers that make up the work team.

                Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon Cognito use `CognitoMemberDefinition`. For workforces created using your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use `OidcMemberDefinition`. You should not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.

                For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams correspond to Amazon Cognito *user groups* within the user pool used to create a workforce. All of the `CognitoMemberDefinition` objects that make up the member definition must have the same `ClientId` and `UserPool` values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing worker pool, see [Adding groups to a User Pool](). For more information about user pools, see [Amazon Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html).

                For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user groups that you want to include in your private work team in `OidcMemberDefinition` by listing those groups in `Groups`. Be aware that user groups that are already in the work team must also be listed in `Groups` when you make this request to remain on the work team. If you do not include these user groups, they will no longer be associated with the work team you update.

            An AutoML job in SageMaker AI is a fully automated process that allows you to build machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise. When initiating an AutoML job, you provide your data and optionally specify parameters tailored to your use case. SageMaker AI then automates the entire model development lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation. AutoML jobs are designed to simplify and accelerate the model building process by automating various tasks and exploring different combinations of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter values. The output of an AutoML job comprises one or more trained models ready for deployment and inference. Additionally, SageMaker AI AutoML jobs generate a candidate model leaderboard, allowing you to select the best-performing model for deployment.

            For more information about AutoML jobs, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html) in the SageMaker AI developer guide.

            AutoML jobs V2 support various problem types such as regression, binary, and multiclass classification with tabular data, text and image classification, time-series forecasting, and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for text generation.

            [CreateAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoMLJobV2.html) and [DescribeAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoMLJobV2.html) are new versions of [CreateAutoMLJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoMLJob.html) and [DescribeAutoMLJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoMLJob.html) which offer backward compatibility.

            `CreateAutoMLJobV2` can manage tabular problem types identical to those of its previous version `CreateAutoMLJob`, as well as time-series forecasting, non-tabular problem types such as image or text classification, and text generation (LLMs fine-tuning).

            Find guidelines about how to migrate a `CreateAutoMLJob` to `CreateAutoMLJobV2` in [Migrate a CreateAutoMLJob to CreateAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development-create-experiment.html#autopilot-create-experiment-api-migrate-v1-v2).

            For the list of available problem types supported by `CreateAutoMLJobV2`, see [AutoMLProblemTypeConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLProblemTypeConfig.html).

            You can find the best-performing model after you run an AutoML job V2 by calling [DescribeAutoMLJobV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoMLJobV2.html).
        flag:
            auto-ml-compute-config: Specifies the compute configuration for the AutoML job V2.
            auto-ml-job-input-data-config: |-
                An array of channel objects describing the input data and their location. Each channel is a named input source. Similar to the [InputDataConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoMLJob.html#sagemaker-CreateAutoMLJob-request-InputDataConfig) attribute in the `CreateAutoMLJob` input parameters. The supported formats depend on the problem type:

                - For tabular problem types: `S3Prefix`, `ManifestFile`.
                - For image classification: `S3Prefix`, `ManifestFile`, `AugmentedManifestFile`.
                - For text classification: `S3Prefix`.
                - For time-series forecasting: `S3Prefix`.
                - For text generation (LLMs fine-tuning): `S3Prefix`.
            auto-ml-job-name: Identifies an Autopilot job. The name must be unique to your account and is case insensitive.
            auto-ml-job-objective: |-
                Specifies a metric to minimize or maximize as the objective of a job. If not specified, the default objective metric depends on the problem type. For the list of default values per problem type, see [AutoMLJobObjective](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLJobObjective.html).

                - For tabular problem types: You must either provide both the `AutoMLJobObjective` and indicate the type of supervised learning problem in `AutoMLProblemTypeConfig` (`TabularJobConfig.ProblemType`), or none at all.
                - For text generation problem types (LLMs fine-tuning): Fine-tuning language models in Autopilot does not require setting the `AutoMLJobObjective` field. Autopilot fine-tunes LLMs without requiring multiple candidates to be trained and evaluated. Instead, using your dataset, Autopilot directly fine-tunes your target model to enhance a default objective metric, the cross-entropy loss. After fine-tuning a language model, you can evaluate the quality of its generated text using different metrics. For a list of the available metrics, see [Metrics for fine-tuning LLMs in Autopilot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-llms-finetuning-metrics.html).
            auto-ml-problem-type-config: Defines the configuration settings of one of the supported problem types.

After SageMaker processes the number of clusters up to `MaxResults`, it stops the operation and returns the matching clusters up to that point. If all the matching clusters are desired, SageMaker will go through all the clusters until `NextToken` is empty.

            Terminates the ML compute instance. Before terminating the instance, SageMaker AI disconnects the ML storage volume from it. SageMaker AI preserves the ML storage volume. SageMaker AI stops charging you for the ML compute instance when you call `StopNotebookInstance`.

            To access data on the ML storage volume for a notebook instance that has been terminated, call the `StartNotebookInstance` API. `StartNotebookInstance` launches another ML compute instance, configures it, and attaches the preserved ML storage volume so you can continue your work.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return.
            next-token: If more than `MaxResults` resources match the specified `SearchExpression`, the response includes a `NextToken`. The `NextToken` can be passed to the next `SearchRequest` to continue retrieving results.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource: The name of the SageMaker resource to search for.

You must provide at least one subexpression, filter, or nested filter. The maximum number of recursive `SubExpressions`, `NestedFilters`, and `Filters` that can be included in a `SearchExpression` object is 50.
            sort-by: The name of the resource property used to sort the `SearchResults`. The default is `LastModifiedTime`.
            sort-order: How `SearchResults` are ordered. Valid values are `Ascending` or `Descending`. The default is `Descending`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

                An array of `Channel` objects. Each channel is a named input source. `InputDataConfig` describes the input data and its location.

                Algorithms can accept input data from one or more channels. For example, an algorithm might have two channels of input data, `training_data` and `validation_data`. The configuration for each channel provides the S3, EFS, or FSx location where the input data is stored. It also provides information about the stored data: the MIME type, compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in RecordIO format.

                Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, SageMaker either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a local directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as input streams. For example, if you specify an EFS location, input data files are available as input streams. They do not need to be downloaded.

                Your input must be in the same Amazon Web Services region as your training job.

You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. For more information, see [SageMaker Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html).

                To be able to pass this role to SageMaker, the caller of this API must have the `iam:PassRole` permission.
            session-chaining-config: Contains information about attribute-based access control (ABAC) for the training job.
            stopping-condition: |-
                Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot training job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the training job. Use this API to cap model training costs.

                To stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the `SIGTERM` signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost.
            tags: |-
                An array of key-value pairs. You can use tags to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html).

                Do not include any security-sensitive information including account access IDs, secrets, or tokens in any tags. As part of the shared responsibility model, you are responsible for any potential exposure, unauthorized access, or compromise of your sensitive data if caused by any security-sensitive information included in the request tag variable or plain text fields.
            tensor-board-output-config: ""
            training-job-name: The name of the training job. The name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon Web Services account.
            vpc-config: A [VpcConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_VpcConfig.html) object that specifies the VPC that you want your training job to connect to. Control access to and from your training container by configuring the VPC. For more information, see [Protect Training Jobs by Using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-vpc.html).

A user profile represents a single user within a domain, and is the main way to reference a "person" for the purposes of sharing, reporting, and other user-oriented features. This entity is created when a user onboards to a domain. If an administrator invites a person by email or imports them from IAM Identity Center, a user profile is automatically created. A user profile is the primary holder of settings for an individual user and has a reference to the user's private Amazon Elastic File System home directory.

            Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Tag keys must be unique per resource. For more information about tags, see For more information, see [Amazon Web Services Tagging Strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/).

            Tags that you add to a hyperparameter tuning job by calling this API are also added to any training jobs that the hyperparameter tuning job launches after you call this API, but not to training jobs that the hyperparameter tuning job launched before you called this API. To make sure that the tags associated with a hyperparameter tuning job are also added to all training jobs that the hyperparameter tuning job launches, add the tags when you first create the tuning job by specifying them in the `Tags` parameter of [CreateHyperParameterTuningJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHyperParameterTuningJob.html)

            Tags that you add to a SageMaker Domain or User Profile by calling this API are also added to any Apps that the Domain or User Profile launches after you call this API, but not to Apps that the Domain or User Profile launched before you called this API.

To ensure that the records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a slightly larger value. The default value is `6` MB.

                The value of `MaxPayloadInMB` cannot be greater than 100 MB. If you specify the `MaxConcurrentTransforms` parameter, the value of `(MaxConcurrentTransforms * MaxPayloadInMB)` also cannot exceed 100 MB.

                For cases where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to `0`. This feature works only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding.
            model-client-config: Configures the timeout and maximum number of retries for processing a transform job invocation.
            model-name: The name of the model that you want to use for the transform job. `ModelName` must be the name of an existing Amazon SageMaker model within an Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon Web Services account.
            tags: (Optional) An array of key-value pairs. For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what) in the *Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.
            transform-input: Describes the input source and the way the transform job consumes it.
            transform-job-name: The name of the transform job. The name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon Web Services account.
            transform-output: Describes the results of the transform job.
            transform-resources: Describes the resources, including ML instance types and ML instance count, to use for the transform job.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates an endpoint configuration that SageMaker hosting services uses to deploy models. In the configuration, you identify one or more models, created using the `CreateModel` API, to deploy and the resources that you want SageMaker to provision. Then you call the [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html) API.

            Use this API if you want to use SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production.

            In the request, you define a `ProductionVariant`, for each model that you want to deploy. Each `ProductionVariant` parameter also describes the resources that you want SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy.

            If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a `VariantWeight` to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B.

            When you call [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html), a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting [`Eventually Consistent Reads`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html) , the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call [DescribeEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpointConfig.html) before calling [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html) to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.

                The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                - Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

                - Alias name ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`

                The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your `CreateEndpoint`, `UpdateEndpoint` requests. For more information, refer to the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service section [Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html)

                Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on the instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a hardware module on the instance. You can't request a `KmsKeyId` when using an instance type with local storage. If any of the models that you specify in the `ProductionVariants` parameter use nitro-based instances with local storage, do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter. If you specify a value for `KmsKeyId` when using any nitro-based instances with local storage, the call to `CreateEndpointConfig` fails.

                For a list of instance types that support local instance storage, see [Instance Store Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).

        command: |-
            Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks and to update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce configuration.

            The worker portal is now supported in VPC and public internet.

            Use `SourceIpConfig` to restrict worker access to tasks to a specific range of IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a list of up to ten [CIDRs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html). By default, a workforce isn't restricted to specific IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the specified range are denied and get a `Not Found` error message on the worker portal.

            To restrict public internet access for all workers, configure the `SourceIpConfig` CIDR value. For example, when using `SourceIpConfig` with an `IpAddressType` of `IPv4`, you can restrict access to the IPv4 CIDR block "10.0.0.0/16". When using an `IpAddressType` of `dualstack`, you can specify both the IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks, such as "10.0.0.0/16" for IPv4 only, "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56" for IPv6 only, or "10.0.0.0/16" and "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56" for dual stack.

            Amazon SageMaker does not support Source Ip restriction for worker portals in VPC.

            Use `OidcConfig` to update the configuration of a workforce created using your own OIDC IdP.

            You can only update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams using the [DeleteWorkteam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteWorkteam.html) operation.

            After restricting access to a range of IP addresses or updating your OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details about your update workforce using the [DescribeWorkforce](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeWorkforce.html) operation.

            This operation only applies to private workforces.

            node-provisioning-mode: |-
                The mode for provisioning nodes in the cluster. You can specify the following modes:

                - **Continuous**: Scaling behavior that enables 1) concurrent operation execution within instance groups, 2) continuous retry mechanisms for failed operations, 3) enhanced customer visibility into cluster events through detailed event streams, 4) partial provisioning capabilities. Your clusters and instance groups remain `InService` while scaling. This mode is only supported for EKS orchestrated clusters.
            node-recovery: The node recovery mode for the SageMaker HyperPod cluster. When set to `Automatic`, SageMaker HyperPod will automatically reboot or replace faulty nodes when issues are detected. When set to `None`, cluster administrators will need to manually manage any faulty cluster instances.
            orchestrator: The type of orchestrator to use for the SageMaker HyperPod cluster. Currently, the only supported value is `"eks"`, which is to use an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service cluster as the orchestrator.
            restricted-instance-groups: The specialized instance groups for training models like Amazon Nova to be created in the SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
            tags: Custom tags for managing the SageMaker HyperPod cluster as an Amazon Web Services resource. You can add tags to your cluster in the same way you add them in other Amazon Web Services services that support tagging. To learn more about tagging Amazon Web Services resources in general, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html).
            tiered-storage-config: The configuration for managed tier checkpointing on the HyperPod cluster. When enabled, this feature uses a multi-tier storage approach for storing model checkpoints, providing faster checkpoint operations and improved fault tolerance across cluster nodes.
            vpc-config: |-
                Specifies the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that is associated with the Amazon SageMaker HyperPod cluster. You can control access to and from your resources by configuring your VPC. For more information, see [Give SageMaker access to resources in your Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/infrastructure-give-access.html).

                When your Amazon VPC and subnets support IPv6, network communications differ based on the cluster orchestration platform:

                - Slurm-orchestrated clusters automatically configure nodes with dual IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, allowing immediate IPv6 network communications.
                - In Amazon EKS-orchestrated clusters, nodes receive dual-stack addressing, but pods can only use IPv6 when the Amazon EKS cluster is explicitly IPv6-enabled. For information about deploying an IPv6 Amazon EKS cluster, see [Amazon EKS IPv6 Cluster Deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/deploy-ipv6-cluster.html#_deploy_an_ipv6_cluster_with_eksctl).

                Additional resources for IPv6 configuration:

                - For information about adding IPv6 support to your VPC, see to [IPv6 Support for VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-migrate-ipv6.html).
                - For information about creating a new IPv6-compatible VPC, see [Amazon VPC Creation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html).

            Creates a lifecycle configuration that you can associate with a notebook instance. A *lifecycle configuration* is a collection of shell scripts that run when you create or start a notebook instance.

            Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 characters.

            The value of the `$PATH` environment variable that is available to both scripts is `/sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin`.

            View Amazon CloudWatch Logs for notebook instance lifecycle configurations in log group `/aws/sagemaker/NotebookInstances` in log stream `[notebook-instance-name]/[LifecycleConfigHook]`.

            Lifecycle configuration scripts cannot run for longer than 5 minutes. If a script runs for longer than 5 minutes, it fails and the notebook instance is not created or started.

            For information about notebook instance lifestyle configurations, see [Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html).

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files.\n\nSageMaker AI uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see [Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/encryption-at-rest.html).\n\n**VPC configuration**\n\nAll traffic between the domain and the Amazon EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets.

The following options are available:\n\n- `PublicInternetOnly` - Non-EFS traffic goes through a VPC managed by Amazon SageMaker AI, which allows internet access. This is the default value.\n- `VpcOnly` - All traffic is through the specified VPC and subnets. Internet access is disabled by default. To allow internet access, you must specify a NAT gateway.\n  \n  When internet access is disabled, you won't be able to run a Amazon SageMaker AI Studio notebook or to train or host models unless your VPC has an interface endpoint to the SageMaker AI API and runtime or a NAT gateway and your security groups allow outbound connections.\n\nNFS traffic over TCP on port 2049 needs to be allowed in both inbound and outbound rules in order to launch a Amazon SageMaker AI Studio app successfully.\n\nFor more information, see [Connect Amazon SageMaker AI Studio Notebooks to Resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-notebooks-and-internet-access.html)."

            When `StatusEquals` and `MaxResults` are set at the same time, the `MaxResults` number of training jobs are first retrieved ignoring the `StatusEquals` parameter and then they are filtered by the `StatusEquals` parameter, which is returned as a response.

            For example, if `ListTrainingJobs` is invoked with the following parameters:

            `{ ... MaxResults: 100, StatusEquals: InProgress ... }`

            First, 100 trainings jobs with any status, including those other than `InProgress`, are selected (sorted according to the creation time, from the most current to the oldest). Next, those with a status of `InProgress` are returned.

            Creates a job that uses workers to label the data objects in your input dataset. You can use the labeled data to train machine learning models.

            You can select your workforce from one of three providers:

            - A private workforce that you create. It can include employees, contractors, and outside experts. Use a private workforce when want the data to stay within your organization or when a specific set of skills is required.
            - One or more vendors that you select from the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. Vendors provide expertise in specific areas.
            - The Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. This is the largest workforce, but it should only be used for public data or data that has been stripped of any personally identifiable information.

            You can also use *automated data labeling* to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses *active learning* to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see [Using Automated Data Labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html).

            The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a *manifest file* that describes the location of each object. For more information, see [Using Input and Output Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-data.html).

            The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models.

            You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in `ManifestS3Uri` have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active (`InProgress`) streaming labeling job in real time. To learn how to create a static labeling job, see [Create a Labeling Job (API)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-create-labeling-job-api.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide. To learn how to create a streaming labeling job, see [Create a Streaming Labeling Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-streaming-create-job.html).

                `"document-version": "2018-11-28",`

                `"labels": [{"label": "label_1"},{"label": "label_2"},...{"label": "label_n"}]`

                `}`

                Note the following about the label category configuration file:

                - For image classification and text classification (single and multi-label) you must specify at least two label categories. For all other task types, the minimum number of label categories required is one.
                - Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate label categories.
                - If you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or verification labeling job, you must include `auditLabelAttributeName` in the label category configuration. Use this parameter to enter the [`LabelAttributeName`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelAttributeName) of the labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.
            labeling-job-algorithms-config: Configures the information required to perform automated data labeling.
            labeling-job-name: The name of the labeling job. This name is used to identify the job in a list of labeling jobs. Labeling job names must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account and region. `LabelingJobName` is not case sensitive. For example, Example-job and example-job are considered the same labeling job name by Ground Truth.
            output-config: The location of the output data and the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service key ID for the key used to encrypt the output data, if any.
            role-arn: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) that Amazon SageMaker assumes to perform tasks on your behalf during data labeling. You must grant this role the necessary permissions so that Amazon SageMaker can successfully complete data labeling.
            stopping-conditions: A set of conditions for stopping the labeling job. If any of the conditions are met, the job is automatically stopped. You can use these conditions to control the cost of data labeling.
            tags: An array of key/value pairs. For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what) in the *Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

            Reboots specific nodes within a SageMaker HyperPod cluster using a soft recovery mechanism. `BatchRebootClusterNodes` performs a graceful reboot of the specified nodes by calling the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud `RebootInstances` API, which attempts to cleanly shut down the operating system before restarting the instance.

            This operation is useful for recovering from transient issues or applying certain configuration changes that require a restart.

            - Rebooting a node may cause temporary service interruption for workloads running on that node. Ensure your workloads can handle node restarts or use appropriate scheduling to minimize impact.
            - You can reboot up to 25 nodes in a single request.
            - For SageMaker HyperPod clusters using the Slurm workload manager, ensure rebooting nodes will not disrupt critical cluster operations.

            Creates a SageMaker *experiment*. An experiment is a collection of *trials* that are observed, compared and evaluated as a group. A trial is a set of steps, called *trial components*, that produce a machine learning model.

            In the Studio UI, trials are referred to as *run groups* and trial components are referred to as *runs*.

            The goal of an experiment is to determine the components that produce the best model. Multiple trials are performed, each one isolating and measuring the impact of a change to one or more inputs, while keeping the remaining inputs constant.

            When you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experiments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked, logged, and indexed. When you use the Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto), you must use the logging APIs provided by the SDK.

            You can add tags to experiments, trials, trial components and then use the [Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_Search.html) API to search for the tags.

            To add a description to an experiment, specify the optional `Description` parameter. To add a description later, or to change the description, call the [UpdateExperiment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateExperiment.html) API.

            To get a list of all your experiments, call the [ListExperiments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_ListExperiments.html) API. To view an experiment's properties, call the [DescribeExperiment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeExperiment.html) API. To get a list of all the trials associated with an experiment, call the [ListTrials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_ListTrials.html) API. To create a trial call the [CreateTrial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrial.html) API.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of model cards to list.
            model-card-status: Only list model cards with the specified approval status.
            name-contains: Only list model cards with names that contain the specified string.
            next-token: If the response to a previous `ListModelCards` request was truncated, the response includes a `NextToken`. To retrieve the next set of model cards, use the token in the next request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-by: Sort model cards by either name or creation time. Sorts by creation time by default.
            sort-order: Sort model cards by ascending or descending order.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            kms-key: "The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance that hosts the endpoint. The `KmsKey` can be any of the following formats:\n\n- KMS key ID\n  \n  `\"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab\"`\n- Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key\n  \n  `\"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab\"`\n- KMS key Alias\n  \n  `\"alias/ExampleAlias\"`\n- Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key Alias\n  \n  `\"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias\"`\n\nIf you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the Amazon SageMaker execution role must include permissions to call `kms:Encrypt`. If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. Amazon SageMaker uses server-side encryption with KMS managed keys for `OutputDataConfig`. If you use a bucket policy with an `s3:PutObject` permission that only allows objects with server-side encryption, set the condition key of `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption` to `\"aws:kms\"`. For more information, see [KMS managed Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.*\n\nThe KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your `CreateEndpoint` and `UpdateEndpoint` requests.

            role-arn: The ARN of the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and container images, and manage Amazon SageMaker Inference endpoints for model deployment.
            schedule: The duration for which you want the inference experiment to run. If you don't specify this field, the experiment automatically starts immediately upon creation and concludes after 7 days.
            shadow-mode-config: The configuration of `ShadowMode` inference experiment type. Use this field to specify a production variant which takes all the inference requests, and a shadow variant to which Amazon SageMaker replicates a percentage of the inference requests. For the shadow variant also specify the percentage of requests that Amazon SageMaker replicates.
            tags: Array of key-value pairs. You can use tags to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

        command: |-
            Returns a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a notebook instance. In the SageMaker AI console, when you choose `Open` next to a notebook instance, SageMaker AI opens a new tab showing the Jupyter server home page from the notebook instance. The console uses this API to get the URL and show the page.

            The IAM role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to access the notebook instance. Once the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request and WebSocket frame that attempts to connect to the notebook instance.

            You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a list of IP addresses that you specify. Use the `NotIpAddress` condition operator and the `aws:SourceIP` condition context key to specify the list of IP addresses that you want to have access to the notebook instance. For more information, see [Limit Access to a Notebook Instance by IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#nbi-ip-filter).

            The URL that you get from a call to [CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl.html) is valid only for 5 minutes. If you try to use the URL after the 5-minute limit expires, you are directed to the Amazon Web Services console sign-in page.

The `NextToken` indicates that the user should get the next set of results by providing this token as a part of a subsequent call. The default value for `MaxResults` is 10.
            next-token: If the previous response was truncated, you will receive this token. Use it in your next request to receive the next set of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-by: The parameter by which to sort the results. The default is CreationTime.
            sort-order: The sort order for the results. The default is Ascending.
            space-name-equals: A parameter to search by space name. If `UserProfileNameEquals` is set, then this value cannot be set.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

      documentation:
        command: "Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the [CreateEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpointConfig.html) API.\n\nUse this API to deploy models using SageMaker hosting services.\n\nYou must not delete an `EndpointConfig` that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the `UpdateEndpoint` or `CreateEndpoint` operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new `EndpointConfig`.\n\nThe endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account.\n\nWhen it receives the request, SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them.\n\nWhen you call [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html), a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting [`Eventually Consistent Reads`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html) , the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call [DescribeEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpointConfig.html) before calling [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html) to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.\n\nWhen SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to `Creating`. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to `InService`. SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the [DescribeEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpoint.html) API.\n\nIf any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see [Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide*.\n\nTo add the IAM role policies for using this API operation, go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), and choose Roles in the left navigation pane. Search the IAM role that you want to grant access to use the [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html) and [CreateEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpointConfig.html) API operations, add the following policies to the role.\n\n- Option 1: For a full SageMaker access, search and attach the `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` policy.\n- Option 2: For granting a limited access to an IAM role, paste the following Action elements manually into the JSON file of the IAM role:\n  \n  `\"Action\": [\"sagemaker:CreateEndpoint\", \"sagemaker:CreateEndpointConfig\"]`\n  \n  `\"Resource\": [`\n  \n  `\"arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint/endpointName\"`\n  \n  `\"arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint-config/endpointConfigName\"`\n  \n  `]`\n  \n  For more information, see [SageMaker API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/api-permissions-reference.html)."

            Creates a URL for a specified UserProfile in a Domain. When accessed in a web browser, the user will be automatically signed in to the domain, and granted access to all of the Apps and files associated with the Domain's Amazon Elastic File System volume. This operation can only be called when the authentication mode equals IAM.

            The IAM role or user passed to this API defines the permissions to access the app. Once the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request and WebSocket frame that attempts to connect to the app.

            You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a list of IP addresses, Amazon VPCs or Amazon VPC Endpoints that you specify. For more information, see [Connect to Amazon SageMaker AI Studio Through an Interface VPC Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-interface-endpoint.html) .

            - The URL that you get from a call to `CreatePresignedDomainUrl` has a default timeout of 5 minutes. You can configure this value using `ExpiresInSeconds`. If you try to use the URL after the timeout limit expires, you are directed to the Amazon Web Services console sign-in page.
            - The JupyterLab session default expiration time is 12 hours. You can configure this value using SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds.

            Deletes an endpoint. SageMaker frees up all of the resources that were deployed when the endpoint was created.

            SageMaker retires any custom KMS key grants associated with the endpoint, meaning you don't need to use the [RevokeGrant](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeGrant.html) API call.

            When you delete your endpoint, SageMaker asynchronously deletes associated endpoint resources such as KMS key grants. You might still see these resources in your account for a few minutes after deleting your endpoint. Do not delete or revoke the permissions for your `ExecutionRoleArn`, otherwise SageMaker cannot delete these resources.

            Stops a pipeline execution.

            **Callback Step**

            A pipeline execution won't stop while a callback step is running. When you call `StopPipelineExecution` on a pipeline execution with a running callback step, SageMaker Pipelines sends an additional Amazon SQS message to the specified SQS queue. The body of the SQS message contains a "Status" field which is set to "Stopping".

            You should add logic to your Amazon SQS message consumer to take any needed action (for example, resource cleanup) upon receipt of the message followed by a call to `SendPipelineExecutionStepSuccess` or `SendPipelineExecutionStepFailure`.

            Only when SageMaker Pipelines receives one of these calls will it stop the pipeline execution.

            **Lambda Step**

            A pipeline execution can't be stopped while a lambda step is running because the Lambda function invoked by the lambda step can't be stopped. If you attempt to stop the execution while the Lambda function is running, the pipeline waits for the Lambda function to finish or until the timeout is hit, whichever occurs first, and then stops. If the Lambda function finishes, the pipeline execution status is `Stopped`. If the timeout is hit the pipeline execution status is `Failed`.

            Updates the feature group by either adding features or updating the online store configuration. Use one of the following request parameters at a time while using the `UpdateFeatureGroup` API.

            You can add features for your feature group using the `FeatureAdditions` request parameter. Features cannot be removed from a feature group.

            You can update the online store configuration by using the `OnlineStoreConfig` request parameter. If a `TtlDuration` is specified, the default `TtlDuration` applies for all records added to the feature group *after the feature group is updated*. If a record level `TtlDuration` exists from using the `PutRecord` API, the record level `TtlDuration` applies to that record instead of the default `TtlDuration`. To remove the default `TtlDuration` from an existing feature group, use the `UpdateFeatureGroup` API and set the `TtlDuration` `Unit` and `Value` to `null`.
