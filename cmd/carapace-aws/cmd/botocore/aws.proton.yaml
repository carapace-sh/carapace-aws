            Deploy a new environment. An Proton environment is created from an environment template that defines infrastructure and resources that can be shared across services.

            **You can provision environments using the following methods:**

            - Amazon Web Services-managed provisioning: Proton makes direct calls to provision your resources.
            - Self-managed provisioning: Proton makes pull requests on your repository to provide compiled infrastructure as code (IaC) files that your IaC engine uses to provision resources.

            For more information, see [Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-environments.html) and [Provisioning methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-works-prov-methods.html) in the *Proton User Guide*.

            If the environment is associated with an environment account connection, *don't* update or include the `protonServiceRoleArn` and `provisioningRepository` parameter to update or connect to an environment account connection.

            You can only update to a new environment account connection if that connection was created in the same environment account that the current environment account connection was created in. The account connection must also be associated with the current environment.

            If the environment *isn't* associated with an environment account connection, *don't* update or include the `environmentAccountConnectionId` parameter. You *can't* update or connect the environment to an environment account connection if it *isn't* already associated with an environment connection.

            You can update either the `environmentAccountConnectionId` or `protonServiceRoleArn` parameter and value. You can’t update both.

            If the environment was configured for Amazon Web Services-managed provisioning, omit the `provisioningRepository` parameter.

            If the environment was configured for self-managed provisioning, specify the `provisioningRepository` parameter and omit the `protonServiceRoleArn` and `environmentAccountConnectionId` parameters.

            For more information, see [Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-environments.html) and [Provisioning methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-works-prov-methods.html) in the *Proton User Guide*.

            There are four modes for updating an environment. The `deploymentType` field defines the mode.

            `NONE`

            In this mode, a deployment *doesn't* occur. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated.

            `CURRENT_VERSION`

            In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. *Don’t* include minor or major version parameters when you use this `deployment-type`.

            `MINOR_VERSION`

            In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major version in use.

            `MAJOR_VERSION`

            In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template, by default. You can also specify a different major version that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

                The deployment type.

                There are four modes for updating a service pipeline. The `deploymentType` field defines the mode.

                `NONE`

                In this mode, a deployment *doesn't* occur. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated.

                `CURRENT_VERSION`

                In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. *Don’t* include major or minor version parameters when you use this `deployment-type`.

                `MINOR_VERSION`

                In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can specify a different minor version of the current major version in use.

                `MAJOR_VERSION`

                In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template, by default. You can specify a different major version that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

            Create and register a link to a repository. Proton uses the link to repeatedly access the repository, to either push to it (self-managed provisioning) or pull from it (template sync). You can share a linked repository across multiple resources (like environments using self-managed provisioning, or synced templates). When you create a repository link, Proton creates a [service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) for you.

            Get counts of Proton resources.

            For infrastructure-provisioning resources (environments, services, service instances, pipelines), the action returns staleness counts. A resource is stale when it's behind the recommended version of the Proton template that it uses and it needs an update to become current.

            The action returns staleness counts (counts of resources that are up-to-date, behind a template major version, or behind a template minor version), the total number of resources, and the number of resources that are in a failed state, grouped by resource type. Components, environments, and service templates return less information - see the `components`, `environments`, and `serviceTemplates` field descriptions.

            For context, the action also returns the total number of each type of Proton template in the Amazon Web Services account.

        This is the Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the [actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) and [data types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html) for the Proton service.

        The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response.

        Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an API. For more information, see the [Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html).

        The Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments.

        Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations.

        When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on Proton, developers need permissions to the service *create*, *list*, *update* and *delete* API operations and the service instance *list* and *update* API operations.

        To learn more about Proton, see the [Proton User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).

        **Ensuring Idempotency**

        When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.

        *Idempotency* ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status.

        The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency.

        **Idempotent create APIs with a client token**

        The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a *client token*. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you *don't* reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.

        Given a request action that has succeeded:

        If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.

        If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a `ValidationException` with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

        Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created.

        If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created.

        Idempotent create APIs with a client token:

        - CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion
        - CreateServiceTemplateVersion
        - CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection

        **Idempotent create APIs**

        Given a request action that has succeeded:

        If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource *hasn't* been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.

        If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a `ConflictException`.

        If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a `ValidationException` with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

        Idempotent create APIs:

        - CreateEnvironmentTemplate
        - CreateServiceTemplate
        - CreateEnvironment
        - CreateService

        **Idempotent delete APIs**

        Given a request action that has succeeded:

        When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in the response.

        If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty.

        In both cases, the retry succeeds.

        Idempotent delete APIs:

        - DeleteEnvironmentTemplate
        - DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion
        - DeleteServiceTemplate
        - DeleteServiceTemplateVersion
        - DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection

        **Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs**

        Given a request action that has succeeded:

        If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any further actions.

        If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response.

        Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:

        - DeleteEnvironment
        - DeleteService
