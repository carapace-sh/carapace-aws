        command: Disconnects a connected MQTT client from Amazon Web Services IoT Core. When you disconnect a client, Amazon Web Services IoT Core closes the client's network connection and optionally cleans the session state.
        flag:
            clean-session: Specifies whether to remove the client's session state when disconnecting. Set to `TRUE` to delete all session information, including subscriptions and queued messages. Set to `FALSE` to preserve the session state. By default, this is set to `FALSE` (preserves the session state).

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

        IoT data

        IoT data enables secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. It implements a broker for applications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent representation of your things and their state in the Amazon Web Services cloud.

        Find the endpoint address for actions in IoT data by running this CLI command:

        `aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS`

        The service name used by [Amazon Web ServicesSignature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to sign requests is: *iotdevicegateway*.
