        command: |-
            Returns cost efficiency metrics aggregated over time and optionally grouped by a specified dimension. The metrics provide insights into your cost optimization progress by tracking estimated savings, spending, and measures how effectively you're optimizing your Cloud resources.

            The operation supports both daily and monthly time granularities and allows grouping results by account ID, Amazon Web Services Region. Results are returned as time-series data, enabling you to analyze trends in your cost optimization performance over the specified time period.

            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            granularity: The time granularity for the cost efficiency metrics. Specify `Daily` for metrics aggregated by day, or `Monthly` for metrics aggregated by month.
            group-by: The dimension by which to group the cost efficiency metrics. Valid values include account ID, Amazon Web Services Region. When no grouping is specified, metrics are aggregated across all resources in the specified time period.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of groups to return in the response. Valid values range from 0 to 1000. Use in conjunction with `nextToken` to paginate through results when the total number of groups exceeds this limit.
            next-token: The token to retrieve the next page of results. This value is returned in the response when the number of groups exceeds the specified `maxResults` value.
            order-by: The ordering specification for the results. Defines which dimension to sort by and whether to sort in ascending or descending order.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            time-period: The time period for which to retrieve the cost efficiency metrics. The start date is inclusive and the end date is exclusive. Dates can be specified in either YYYY-MM-DD format or YYYY-MM format depending on the desired granularity.
