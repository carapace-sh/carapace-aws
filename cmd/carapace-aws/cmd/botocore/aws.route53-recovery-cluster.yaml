            Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When a routing control state is set to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is set to OFF, traffic does not flow.

            Before you can create a routing control, you must first create a cluster, and then host the control in a control panel on the cluster. For more information, see [Create routing control structures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.create.html) in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide. You access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing control state to redirect traffic for your application.

            *You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.*

            To see a code example for getting a routing control state, including accessing Regional cluster endpoints in sequence, see [API examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/service_code_examples_actions.html) in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

            With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which are safeguards for routing control state updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail open traffic routing. However, there are scenarios when you might want to bypass the routing control safeguards that are enforced with safety rules that you've configured. For example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one or more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a routing control state and fail over your application.

            The `SafetyRulesToOverride` property enables you override one or more safety rules and update routing control states.
