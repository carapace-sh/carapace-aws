                Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services populates this field.

                **What is idempotency?**

                When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the operation's asynchronous workflows have completed. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they complete, even though the request has already returned a result. This could make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded or not, and could lead to multiple retries to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation is completed multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.

                *Idempotency* ensures that an API request completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more results exist than the specified `MaxResults` value, a token is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.
            next-token: If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the `NextToken` request parameter in a next call to the operation to get more output. You can repeat this until the `NextToken` response element returns `null`.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services populates this field.

                **What is idempotency?**

                When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the operation's asynchronous workflows have completed. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they complete, even though the request has already returned a result. This could make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded or not, and could lead to multiple retries to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation is completed multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.

                *Idempotency* ensures that an API request completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions.

        Multi-party approval is a capability of [Organizations](http://aws.amazon.com/organizations) that allows you to protect a predefined list of operations through a distributed approval process. Use Multi-party approval to establish approval workflows and transform security processes into team-based decisions.

        **When to use Multi-party approval**:

        - You need to align with the Zero Trust principle of "never trust, always verify"
        - You need to make sure that the right humans have access to the right things in the right way
        - You need distributed decision-making for sensitive or critical operations
        - You need to protect against unintended operations on sensitive or critical resources
        - You need formal reviews and approvals for auditing or compliance reasons

        For more information, see [What is Multi-party approval](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the *Multi-party approval User Guide*.
