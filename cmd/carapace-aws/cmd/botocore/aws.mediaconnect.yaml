                The maximum number of results to return per API request.

                For example, you submit a `ListFlows` request with MaxResults set at 5. Although 20 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 5 items. (The service also returns a `NextToken` value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.)

                The service might return fewer results than the `MaxResults` value. If `MaxResults` is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 10 results per page.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

            protocol: |-
                The protocol that the source uses to deliver the content to MediaConnect.

                Elemental MediaConnect no longer supports the Fujitsu QoS protocol. This reference is maintained for legacy purposes only.
            router-integration-state: Indicates whether to enable or disable router integration for this flow source.
            router-integration-transit-decryption: The encryption configuration for the flow source when router integration is enabled.
            sender-control-port: The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to initiate connection with the sender.
            sender-ip-address: The IP address that the flow communicates with to initiate connection with the sender.
            source-arn: The ARN of the source that you want to update.
            source-listener-address: The source IP or domain name for SRT-caller protocol.
            source-listener-port: Source port for SRT-caller protocol.
            stream-id: The stream ID that you want to use for this transport. This parameter applies only to Zixi and SRT caller-based streams.
            vpc-interface-name: The name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to.
            whitelist-cidr: The range of IP addresses that are allowed to contribute content to your source. Format the IP addresses as a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results to return per API request.

                For example, you submit a ListInstances request with `MaxResults` set at 5. Although 20 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 5 items. (The service also returns a `NextToken` value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.)

                The service might return fewer results than the `MaxResults` value. If `MaxResults` is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 10 results per page.
            next-token: |-
                The token that identifies the batch of results that you want to see.

                For example, you submit a `ListInstances` request with `MaxResults` set at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5) and a `NextToken` value. To see the next batch of results, you can submit the `ListInstances` request a second time and specify the `NextToken` value.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
