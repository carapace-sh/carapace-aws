            There are new tiers for Amazon Q Business. Not all features in Amazon Q Business Pro are also available in Amazon Q Business Lite. For information on what's included in Amazon Q Business Lite and what's included in Amazon Q Business Pro, see [Amazon Q Business tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tiers.html#user-sub-tiers). You must use the Amazon Q Business console to assign subscription tiers to users.

            An Amazon Q Apps service linked role will be created if it's absent in the Amazon Web Services account when `QAppsConfiguration` is enabled in the request. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Q Apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/using-service-linked-roles-qapps.html).

            When you create an application, Amazon Q Business may securely transmit data for processing from your selected Amazon Web Services region, but within your geography. For more information, see [Cross region inference in Amazon Q Business](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/cross-region-inference.html).

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of messages to return.
            next-token: If the number of messages returned exceeds `maxResults`, Amazon Q Business returns a next token as a pagination token to retrieve the next set of messages.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                The `chatMode` parameter determines the chat modes available to Amazon Q Business users:

                - `RETRIEVAL_MODE` - If you choose this mode, Amazon Q generates responses solely from the data sources connected and indexed by the application. If an answer is not found in the data sources or there are no data sources available, Amazon Q will respond with a "*No Answer Found*" message, unless LLM knowledge has been enabled. In that case, Amazon Q will generate a response from the LLM knowledge
                - `CREATOR_MODE` - By selecting this mode, you can choose to generate responses only from the LLM knowledge. You can also attach files and have Amazon Q generate a response based on the data in those files. If the attached files do not contain an answer for the query, Amazon Q will automatically fall back to generating a response from the LLM knowledge.
                - `PLUGIN_MODE` - By selecting this mode, users can choose to use plugins in chat to get their responses.

                If none of the modes are selected, Amazon Q will only respond using the information from the attached files.

                Configuration information to connect your data source repository to Amazon Q Business. Use this parameter to provide a JSON schema with configuration information specific to your data source connector.

                Each data source has a JSON schema provided by Amazon Q Business that you must use. For example, the Amazon S3 and Web Crawler connectors require the following JSON schemas:

                - [Amazon S3 JSON schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/s3-api.html)
                - [Web Crawler JSON schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/web-crawler-api.html)

                You can find configuration templates for your specific data source using the following steps:

                1. Navigate to the [Supported connectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/connectors-list.html) page in the Amazon Q Business User Guide, and select the data source of your choice.
                2. Then, from your specific data source connector page, select **Using the API**. You will find the JSON schema for your data source, including parameter descriptions, in this section.

        This is the *Amazon Q Business* API Reference. Amazon Q Business is a fully managed, generative-AI powered enterprise chat assistant that you can deploy within your organization. Amazon Q Business enhances employee productivity by supporting key tasks such as question-answering, knowledge discovery, writing email messages, summarizing text, drafting document outlines, and brainstorming ideas. Users ask questions of Amazon Q Business and get answers that are presented in a conversational manner. For an introduction to the service, see the [*Amazon Q Business User Guide*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/what-is.html) .

        For an overview of the Amazon Q Business APIs, see [Overview of Amazon Q Business API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/api-ref.html#api-overview).
