Response of this API provides a token required to obtain credentials from the [CreateParticipantConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-participant/latest/APIReference/API_CreateParticipantConnection.html) API in the Amazon Connect Participant Service.

            When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe to the participant’s connection for the created chat within 5 minutes. This is achieved by invoking [CreateParticipantConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-participant/latest/APIReference/API_CreateParticipantConnection.html) with WEBSOCKET and CONNECTION\_CREDENTIALS.

            - If the API is called *after* the agent joins the call, recording starts at the time of the API call.

            StartContactRecording is a one-time action. For example, if you use StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios where the recording has started and you want to suspend and resume it, such as when collecting sensitive information (for example, a credit card number), use SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.

            We strongly recommend limiting who has the ability to invoke `UpdateUserIdentityInfo`. Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of other users by changing their email address. This poses a security risk to your organization. They can change the email address of a user to the attacker's email address, and then reset the password through email.

            You can create or update user-defined attributes for both ongoing and completed contacts. For example, while the call is active, you can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called. You can add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that display to the next agent that takes the call. You can also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers.

            Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted. For information about contact record retention and the maximum size of the contact record attributes section, see [Feature specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

                In the [Set contact attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-contact-attributes.html) block, when the attributes for a contact exceed 32 KB, the contact is routed down the Error branch of the flow. As a mitigation, consider the following options:

                - Remove unnecessary attributes by setting their values to empty.
                - If the attributes are only used in one flow and don't need to be referred to outside of that flow (for example, by a Lambda or another flow), then use flow attributes. This way you aren't needlessly persisting the 32 KB of information from one flow to another.

            - If the phone number is claimed to a traffic distribution group that was created in the same Region as the Amazon Connect instance where you are calling this API, then you can use a full phone number ARN or a UUID for `OutboundCallerIdNumberId`. However, if the phone number is claimed to a traffic distribution group that is in one Region, and you are calling this API from an instance in another Amazon Web Services Region that is associated with the traffic distribution group, you must provide a full phone number ARN. If a UUID is provided in this scenario, you will receive a `ResourceNotFoundException`.

            Searches evaluation forms in an Amazon Connect instance, with optional filtering.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - List all evaluation forms in an instance.
            - Find all evaluation forms that meet specific criteria, such as Title, Description, Status, and more.
            - Find all evaluation forms that are tagged with a specific set of tags.

            **Important things to know**

            - A Search operation, unlike a List operation, takes time to index changes to resource (create, update or delete). If you don't see updated information for recently changed contact evaluations, try calling the API again in a few seconds.

            **Endpoints**: See [Amazon Connect endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

            Releases a phone number previously claimed to an Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution group. You can call this API only in the Amazon Web Services Region where the number was claimed.

            To release phone numbers from a traffic distribution group, use the `ReleasePhoneNumber` API, not the Amazon Connect admin website.

            After releasing a phone number, the phone number enters into a cooldown period for up to 180 days. It cannot be searched for or claimed again until the period has ended. If you accidentally release a phone number, contact Amazon Web Services Support.

            If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more numbers until up to 180 days past the oldest number released has expired.

            By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 180 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 180 days past the oldest number released has expired.

            For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 180 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.

            This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to change.

            Initiates an Amazon Connect instance with all the supported channels enabled. It does not attach any storage, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Kinesis. It also does not allow for any configurations on features, such as Contact Lens for Amazon Connect.

            For more information, see [Create an Amazon Connect instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-instances.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

            Amazon Connect enforces a limit on the total number of instances that you can create or delete in 30 days. If you exceed this limit, you will get an error message indicating there has been an excessive number of attempts at creating or deleting instances. You must wait 30 days before you can restart creating and deleting instances in your account.

            Retrieves the position of the contact in the queue.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for position in queue:

            - Understand the expected wait experience of a contact.
            - Inform customers of their position in queue and potentially offer a callback.
            - Make data-driven routing decisions between primary and alternative queues.
            - Enhance queue visibility and leverage agent proficiencies to streamline contact routing.

            **Important things to know**

            - The only way to retrieve the position of the contact in queue is by using this API. You can't retrieve the position by using flows and attributes.
            - For more information, see the [Position in queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html) metric in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

            **Endpoints**: See [Amazon Connect endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

            Claims an available phone number to your Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution group. You can call this API only in the same Amazon Web Services Region where the Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution group was created.

            For more information about how to use this operation, see [Claim a phone number in your country](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/claim-phone-number.html) and [Claim phone numbers to traffic distribution groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/claim-phone-numbers-traffic-distribution-groups.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

            You can call the [SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers.html) API for available phone numbers that you can claim. Call the [DescribePhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePhoneNumber.html) API to verify the status of a previous [ClaimPhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html) operation.

            If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more numbers until up to 180 days past the oldest number released has expired.

            By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 180 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 180 days past the oldest number released has expired.

            For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 180 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.

At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services Support ticket.

            filters: "The filters to apply to returned metrics. You can filter on the following resources:\n\n- Agents\n- Campaigns\n- Channels\n- Feature\n- Queues\n- Routing profiles\n- Routing step expression\n- User hierarchy groups\n\nAt least one filter must be passed from queues, routing profiles, agents, or user hierarchy groups.\n\nFor metrics for outbound campaigns analytics, you can also use campaigns to satisfy at least one filter requirement.\n\nTo filter by phone number, see [Create a historical metrics report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/create-historical-metrics-report.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.\n\nNote the following limits:\n\n- **Filter keys**: A maximum of 5 filter keys are supported in a single request. Valid filter keys: `AGENT` | `AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_ONE` | `AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_TWO` | `AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_THREE` | `AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FOUR` | `AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FIVE` | `ANSWERING_MACHINE_DETECTION_STATUS` | `BOT_ID` | `BOT_ALIAS` | `BOT_VERSION` | `BOT_LOCALE` | `BOT_INTENT_NAME` | `CAMPAIGN` | `CAMPAIGN_DELIVERY_EVENT_TYPE` | `CAMPAIGN_EXCLUDED_EVENT_TYPE` | `CASE_TEMPLATE_ARN` | `CASE_STATUS` | `CHANNEL` | `contact/segmentAttributes/connect:Subtype` | `DISCONNECT_REASON` | `EVALUATION_FORM` | `EVALUATION_SECTION` | `EVALUATION_QUESTION` | `EVALUATION_SOURCE` | `EVALUATOR_ID` | `FEATURE` | `FLOW_ACTION_ID` | `FLOW_TYPE` | `FLOWS_MODULE_RESOURCE_ID` | `FLOWS_NEXT_RESOURCE_ID` | `FLOWS_NEXT_RESOURCE_QUEUE_ID` | `FLOWS_OUTCOME_TYPE` | `FLOWS_RESOURCE_ID` | `FORM_VERSION` | `INITIATION_METHOD` | `INVOKING_RESOURCE_PUBLISHED_TIMESTAMP` | `INVOKING_RESOURCE_TYPE` | `PARENT_FLOWS_RESOURCE_ID` | `RESOURCE_PUBLISHED_TIMESTAMP` | `ROUTING_PROFILE` | `ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION` | `QUEUE` | `Q_CONNECT_ENABLED` |\n- **Filter values**: A maximum of 100 filter values are supported in a single request. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK are valid `filterValue` for the CHANNEL filter key. They do not count towards limitation of 100 filter values. For example, a GetMetricDataV2 request can filter by 50 queues, 35 agents, and 15 routing profiles for a total of 100 filter values, along with 3 channel filters.\n  \n  `contact_lens_conversational_analytics` is a valid filterValue for the `FEATURE` filter key. It is available only to contacts analyzed by Contact Lens conversational analytics.\n  \n  `connect:Chat`, `connect:SMS`, `connect:Telephony`, and `connect:WebRTC` are valid `filterValue` examples (not exhaustive) for the `contact/segmentAttributes/connect:Subtype filter` key.\n  \n  `ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION` is a valid filter key with a filter value up to 3000 length. This filter is case and order sensitive. JSON string fields must be sorted in ascending order and JSON array order should be kept as is.\n  \n  `Q_CONNECT_ENABLED`. TRUE and FALSE are the only valid filterValues for the `Q_CONNECT_ENABLED` filter key.\n  \n  - TRUE includes all contacts that had Amazon Q in Connect enabled as part of the flow.\n  - FALSE includes all contacts that did not have Amazon Q in Connect enabled as part of the flow\n  \n  This filter is available only for contact record-driven metrics.\n  \n  [Campaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_connect-outbound-campaigns_Campaign.html) ARNs are valid `filterValues` for the `CAMPAIGN` filter key."

However, if the phone number is claimed to a traffic distribution group that is in one Region, and you are calling this API from an instance in another Amazon Web Services Region that is associated with the traffic distribution group, you must provide a full phone number ARN. If a UUID is provided in this scenario, you will receive a `ResourceNotFoundException`.
            - Only use the phone number ARN format that doesn't contain `instance` in the path, for example, `arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:1234567890:phone-number/uuid`. This is the same ARN format that is returned when you call the [ListPhoneNumbersV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ListPhoneNumbersV2.html) API.

For example, if a contact that has been queued under `<Expression 1>` for 10 seconds has expired and `<Expression 2>` becomes active, then `OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE` for this queue will be counted starting from 10, not 0.

            filters: |-
                The filters to apply to returned metrics. You can filter up to the following limits:

                - Queues: 100
                - Routing profiles: 100
                - Channels: 3 (VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.)
                - RoutingStepExpressions: 50
                - AgentStatuses: 50

                Metric data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the queues or routing profiles, and by any channels included in the filter. (You cannot filter by both queue AND routing profile.) You can include both resource IDs and resource ARNs in the same request.

                When using `AgentStatuses` as filter make sure Queues is added as primary filter.

                When using the `RoutingStepExpression` filter, you need to pass exactly one `QueueId`. The filter is also case sensitive so when using the `RoutingStepExpression` filter, grouping by `ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION` is required.

                Currently tagging is only supported on the resources that are passed in the filter.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            groupings: |-
                Defines the level of aggregation for metrics data by a dimension(s). Its similar to sorting items into buckets based on a common characteristic, then counting or calculating something for each bucket. For example, when grouped by `QUEUE`, the metrics returned apply to each queue rather than aggregated for all queues.

                The grouping list is an ordered list, with the first item in the list defined as the primary grouping. If no grouping is included in the request, the aggregation happens at the instance-level.

                - If you group by `CHANNEL`, you should include a Channels filter. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.
                - If you group by `AGENT_STATUS`, you must include the `QUEUE` as the primary grouping and use queue filter. When you group by `AGENT_STATUS`, the only metric available is the `AGENTS_ONLINE` metric.
                - If you group by `ROUTING_PROFILE`, you must include either a queue or routing profile filter. In addition, a routing profile filter is required for metrics `CONTACTS_SCHEDULED`, `CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE`, and `OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE`.
                - When using the `RoutingStepExpression` filter, group by `ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION` is required.
            instance-id: The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can [find the instance ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html) in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return per page.
            next-token: |-
                The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the previous response in the next request to retrieve the next set of results.

                The token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created. Subsequent requests that use the token must use the same request parameters as the request that generated the token.
            sort-criteria: |-
                The way to sort the resulting response based on metrics. You can enter one sort criteria. By default resources are sorted based on `AGENTS_ONLINE`, `DESCENDING`. The metric collection is sorted based on the input metrics.

                Note the following:

                - Sorting on `SLOTS_ACTIVE` and `SLOTS_AVAILABLE` is not supported.

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - Retrieve contact information such as the caller's phone number and the specific number the caller dialed to integrate into custom monitoring or custom agent experience solutions.
            - Detect when a customer chat session disconnects due to a network issue on the agent's end. Use the DisconnectReason field in the [ContactTraceRecord](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/ctr-data-model.html#ctr-ContactTraceRecord) to detect this event and then re-queue the chat for followup.
            - Identify after contact work (ACW) duration and call recordings information when a COMPLETED event is received by using the [contact event stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/contact-events.html).

            **Important things to know**

            - `SystemEndpoint` is not populated for contacts with initiation method of MONITOR, QUEUE\_TRANSFER, or CALLBACK
            - Contact information remains available in Amazon Connect for 24 months from the `InitiationTimestamp`, and then it is deleted. Only contact information that is available in Amazon Connect is returned by this API.

            **Endpoints**: See [Amazon Connect endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

            When you shift telephony traffic, also shift agents and/or agent sign-ins to ensure they can handle the calls in the other Region. If you don't shift the agents, voice calls will go to the shifted Region but there won't be any agents available to receive the calls.

If you call `UpdateTrafficDistribution` with a modified `SignInConfig` and a non-default `TrafficDistributionGroup`, an `InvalidRequestException` is returned.

It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability to query longer time ranges than `GetMetricData`. Use it to retrieve historical agent and contact metrics for the last 3 months, at varying intervals. You can also use it to build custom dashboards to measure historical queue and agent performance. For example, you can track the number of incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day, to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.

                If no grouping is specified, a summary of metrics for all queues is returned.

                RoutingStepExpression is not a valid filter for GetMetricData and we recommend switching to GetMetricDataV2 for more up-to-date features.
            historical-metrics: |-
                The metrics to retrieve. Specify the name, unit, and statistic for each metric. The following historical metrics are available. For a description of each metric, see [Metrics definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

                This API does not support a contacts incoming metric (there's no CONTACTS\_INCOMING metric missing from the documented list).

            scheduled-time: The timestamp, in Unix Epoch seconds format, at which to start running the inbound flow. The scheduled time cannot be in the past. It must be within up to 6 days in future.
            segment-attributes: |-
                A set of system defined key-value pairs stored on individual contact segments (unique contact ID) using an attribute map. The attributes are standard Amazon Connect attributes. They can be accessed in flows.

                Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, -, and \_.

                This field can be used to set Contact Expiry as a duration in minutes and set a UserId for the User who created a task.

                To set contact expiry, a ValueMap must be specified containing the integer number of minutes the contact will be active for before expiring, with `SegmentAttributes` like { `"connect:ContactExpiry": {"ValueMap" : { "ExpiryDuration": { "ValueInteger": 135}}}}`.

                To set the created by user, a valid AgentResourceId must be supplied, with `SegmentAttributes` like { `"connect:CreatedByUser" { "ValueString": "arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/agent/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}}}`.
            task-template-id: A unique identifier for the task template. For more information about task templates, see [Create task templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/task-templates.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

            rehydration-type: "The contactId chosen for rehydration depends on the type chosen.\n\n- `ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION`: Rehydrates a chat from the most recently terminated past chat contact of the specified past ended chat session. To use this type, provide the `initialContactId` of the past ended chat session in the `sourceContactId` field. In this type, Amazon Connect determines what the most recent chat contact on the past ended chat session and uses it to start a persistent chat.\n- `FROM_SEGMENT`: Rehydrates a chat from the specified past chat contact provided in the `sourceContactId` field.\n\nThe actual contactId used for rehydration is provided in the response of this API.\n\nTo illustrate how to use rehydration type, consider the following example: A customer starts a chat session. Agent a1 accepts the chat and a conversation starts between the customer and Agent a1. This first contact creates a contact ID **C1**. Agent a1 then transfers the chat to Agent a2. This creates another contact ID **C2**. At this point Agent a2 ends the chat. The customer is forwarded to the disconnect flow for a post chat survey that creates another contact ID **C3**. After the chat survey, the chat session ends. Later, the customer returns and wants to resume their past chat session. At this point, the customer can have following use cases:\n\n- **Use Case 1**: The customer wants to continue the past chat session but they want to hide the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:\n  \n  - **Configuration**\n    \n    - SourceContactId = \"C2\"\n    - RehydrationType = \"FROM\\_SEGMENT\"\n  - **Expected behavior**\n    \n    - This starts a persistent chat session from the specified past ended contact (C2). Transcripts of past chat sessions C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session. Note that chat segment C3 is dropped from the persistent chat session.\n- **Use Case 2**: The customer wants to continue the past chat session and see the transcript of the entire past engagement, including the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:\n  \n  - **Configuration**\n    \n    - SourceContactId = \"C1\"\n    - RehydrationType = \"ENTIRE\\_PAST\\_SESSION\"\n  - **Expected behavior**\n    \n    - This starts a persistent chat session from the most recently ended chat contact (C3).

            Removes the alias association between two email addresses in an Amazon Connect instance. After disassociation, emails sent to the former alias email address are no longer forwarded to the primary email address. Both email addresses continue to exist independently and can receive emails directly.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - **Department separation**: Remove alias relationships when splitting a consolidated support queue back into separate department-specific queues.
            - **Email address retirement**: Cleanly remove forwarding relationships before decommissioning old email addresses.
            - **Organizational restructuring**: Reconfigure email routing when business processes change and aliases are no longer needed.

            **Important things to know**

            - Concurrent operations: This API uses distributed locking, so concurrent operations on the same email addresses may be temporarily blocked.
            - Emails sent to the former alias address are still delivered directly to that address if it exists.
            - You do not need to delete the email addresses after disassociation. Both addresses remain active independently.
            - After a successful disassociation, you can immediately create a new alias relationship with the same addresses.
            - 200 status means alias was successfully disassociated.

            `DisassociateEmailAddressAlias` does not return the following information:

            - Details in the response about the email that was disassociated. The response returns an empty body.
            - The timestamp of when the disassociation occurred.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - Programmatically assign queued contacts to available users.
            - Leverage the IAM context key `connect:PreferredUserArn` to restrict contact association to specific preferred user.

            **Important things to know**

            - Use this API with chat, email, and task contacts. It does not support voice contacts.
            - Use it to associate contacts with users regardless of their current state, including custom states. Ensure your application logic accounts for user availability before making associations.
            - It honors the IAM context key `connect:PreferredUserArn` to prevent unauthorized contact associations.
            - It respects the IAM context key `connect:PreferredUserArn` to enforce authorization controls and prevent unauthorized contact associations. Verify that your IAM policies are properly configured to support your intended use cases.
            - The service quota *Queues per routing profile per instance* applies to manually assigned queues, too. For more information about this quota, see [Amazon Connect quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#connect-quotas) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

            Searches contact evaluations in an Amazon Connect instance, with optional filtering.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - Find contact evaluations by using specific search criteria.
            - Find contact evaluations that are tagged with a specific set of tags.

            **Important things to know**

            - A Search operation, unlike a List operation, takes time to index changes to resource (create, update or delete). If you don't see updated information for recently changed contact evaluations, try calling the API again in a few seconds. Contact Evaluations may not be fully backfilled with historical data in all regions yet, however all recently created Contact Evaluations should be available for search.

        command: |-
            Associates an email address alias with an existing email address in an Amazon Connect instance. This creates a forwarding relationship where emails sent to the alias email address are automatically forwarded to the primary email address.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - **Unified customer support**: Create multiple entry points (for example, support@example.com, help@example.com, customercare@example.com) that all forward to a single agent queue for streamlined management.
            - **Department consolidation**: Forward emails from legacy department addresses (for example, sales@example.com, info@example.com) to a centralized customer service email during organizational restructuring.
            - **Brand management**: Enable you to use familiar brand-specific email addresses that forward to the appropriate Amazon Connect instance email address.

            **Important things to know**

            - Each email address can have a maximum of one alias. You cannot create multiple aliases for the same email address.
            - If the alias email address already receives direct emails, it continues to receive direct emails plus forwarded emails.
            - You cannot chain email aliases together (that is, create an alias of an alias).

            `AssociateEmailAddressAlias` does not return the following information:

            - A confirmation of the alias relationship details (you must call [DescribeEmailAddress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEmailAddress.html) to verify).
            - The timestamp of when the association occurred.
            - The status of the forwarding configuration.

            Creates a new predefined attribute for the specified Amazon Connect instance. A *predefined attribute* is made up of a name and a value.

            For the predefined attributes per instance quota, see [Amazon Connect quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#connect-quotas).

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - Create an attribute for routing proficiency (for example, agent certification) that has predefined values (for example, a list of possible certifications). For more information, see [Create predefined attributes for routing contacts to agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/predefined-attributes.html).
            - Create an attribute for business unit name that has a list of predefined business unit names used in your organization. This is a use case where information for a contact varies between transfers or conferences. For more information, see [Use contact segment attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/use-contact-segment-attributes.html).

            **Endpoints**: See [Amazon Connect endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

            Places an outbound call to a contact, and then initiates the flow. It performs the actions in the flow that's specified (in `ContactFlowId`).

            Agents do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the agent, like any other inbound case.

            Dialing timeout for this operation can be configured with the “RingTimeoutInSeconds” parameter. If not specified, the default dialing timeout will be 60 seconds which means if the call is not connected within 60 seconds, it fails.

            UK numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before you can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit a service quota increase request. For more information, see [Amazon Connect Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

            Campaign calls are not allowed by default. Before you can make a call with `TrafficType` = `CAMPAIGN`, you must submit a service quota increase request to the quota [Amazon Connect campaigns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#outbound-communications-quotas).

            For Preview dialing mode, only the Amazon Connect outbound campaigns service principal is allowed to assume a role in your account and call this API with OutboundStrategy.

            Updates routing priority and age on the contact (**QueuePriority** and **QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds**). These properties can be used to change a customer's position in the queue. For example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by setting a lower routing priority relative to other contacts in queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by increasing the routing age which will make the contact look artificially older and therefore higher up in the first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue, and not its actual queue wait time as reported through metrics. These properties can also be updated by using [the Set routing priority / age flow block](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html).

            Either **QueuePriority** or **QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds** should be provided within the request body, but not both.

        Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at any scale.

        Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents.

        There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see [Amazon Connect Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

        You can use an endpoint to connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see [Amazon Connect Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).
