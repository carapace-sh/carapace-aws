For information about lifecycle configuration, see [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html).\n\nBucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, object size, or any combination of these. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API, which is compatible with the new functionality. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for general purpose buckets for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see [GetBucketLifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycle.html).\n\nLifecyle configurations for directory buckets only support expiring objects and cancelling multipart uploads.

An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by the `CreateMultipartUpload` request, but has not yet been completed or aborted.\n\n**Directory buckets** - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use the `ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket and use the `AbortMultipartUpload` operation to abort all the in-progress multipart uploads.\n\nThe `ListMultipartUploads` operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the `max-uploads` request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy your `ListMultipartUploads` request, the response returns an `IsTruncated` element with the value of `true`, a `NextKeyMarker` element, and a `NextUploadIdMarker` element. To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent `ListMultipartUploads` requests. In these requests, include two query parameters: `key-marker` and `upload-id-marker`. Set the value of `key-marker` to the `NextKeyMarker` value from the previous response. Similarly, set the value of `upload-id-marker` to the `NextUploadIdMarker` value from the previous response.\n\n**Directory buckets** - The `upload-id-marker` element and the `NextUploadIdMarker` element aren't supported by directory buckets. To list the additional multipart uploads, you only need to set the value of `key-marker` to the `NextKeyMarker` value from the previous response.\n\nFor more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported.

Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n\nSorting of multipart uploads in response\n\n- **General purpose bucket** - In the `ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads are sorted based on two criteria:\n  \n  - Key-based sorting - Multipart uploads are initially sorted in ascending order based on their object keys.\n  - Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the same object key, they are further sorted in ascending order based on the upload initiation time. Among uploads with the same key, the one that was initiated first will appear before the ones that were initiated later.\n- **Directory bucket** - In the `ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted lexicographically based on the object keys.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `ListMultipartUploads`:\n\n- [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n- [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n- [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            Sets the `cors` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.

            To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the `s3:PutBucketCORS` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

            You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is `http://www.example.com` to access your Amazon S3 bucket at `my.example.bucket.com` by using the browser's `XMLHttpRequest` capability.

            To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the `cors` subresource to the bucket. The `cors` subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.

            When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the `cors` configuration on the bucket and uses the first `CORSRule` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

            - The request's `Origin` header must match `AllowedOrigin` elements.
            - The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in case of a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request must be one of the `AllowedMethod` elements.
            - Every header specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header of a pre-flight request must match an `AllowedHeader` element.

            For more information about CORS, go to [Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services.

            This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.

            To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the part storage, you should call the [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html) API operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.

            - **Directory buckets** - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use the `ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket and use the `AbortMultipartUpload` operation to abort all the in-progress multipart uploads.
            - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Permissions

            - **General purpose bucket permissions** - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .

            HTTP Host header syntax

            **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

            The following operations are related to `AbortMultipartUpload`:

            - [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)
            - [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)

            - [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        command: "Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.\n\nEnd of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).\n\nYou can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see [Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html).\n\nYou can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between directory buckets, and between general purpose buckets and directory buckets.\n\n- Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Multi-Region Access Points only as a destination when using the Multi-Region Access Point ARN.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- VPC endpoints don't support cross-Region requests (including copies). If you're using VPC endpoints, your source and destination buckets should be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as your VPC endpoint.\n\nBoth the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. For more information about how to enable a Region for your account, see [Enable or disable a Region for standalone accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone) in the *Amazon Web Services Account Management Guide*.\n\nAmazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a `400 Bad Request` error. For more information, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html).\n\nAuthentication and authorization\n\nAll `CopyObject` requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be signed. For more information, see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html).\n\n**Directory buckets** - You must use the IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the `CopyObject` API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API operation.\n\nAmazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.\n\nPermissions\n\nYou must have *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the destination bucket.\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in an IAM policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a `CopyObject` operation.\n  \n  - If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have **`s3:GetObject`** permission to read the source object that is being copied.\n  - If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have **`s3:PutObject`** permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a `CopyObject` operation.\n  \n  - If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the copy source bucket.\n  - If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The `s3express:SessionMode` condition key can't be set to `ReadOnly` on the copy destination bucket.\n  \n  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n  \n  For example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html) and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nResponse and special errors\n\nWhen the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When the request is not an HTTP 1.1 request, the response would not contain the `Content-Length`. You always need to read the entire response body to check if the copy succeeds.\n\n- If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.\n- A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. A `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error.\n  \n  - If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error.\n  - If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the `200 OK` response. For example, in a cross-region copy, you may encounter throttling and receive a `200 OK` response. For more information, see [Resolve the Error 200 response when copying objects to Amazon S3](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-resolve-200-internalerror). The `200 OK` status code means the copy was accepted, but it doesn't mean the copy is complete. Another example is when you disconnect from Amazon S3 before the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you may receive a `200 OK` response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the entire response is successfully received and processed.\n    \n    If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the content of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).\n\nCharge\n\nThe copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. The request can also result in a data retrieval charge for the source if the source storage class bills for data retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the data transfer is billed to the copy source account. For pricing information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n- **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n- **Amazon S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. The hostname isn't required when you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs.\n\nThe following operations are related to `CopyObject`:\n\n- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)\n- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."
        flag:
            acl: |-
                The canned access control list (ACL) to apply to the object.

                When you copy an object, the ACL metadata is not preserved and is set to `private` by default. Only the owner has full access control. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when you generate a copy request. For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html).

                If the destination bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept `PUT` requests that don't specify an ACL or `PUT` requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. For more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                - If your destination bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.
                - This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
                - This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
            bucket: |-
                The name of the destination bucket.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Copying objects across different Amazon Web Services Regions isn't supported when the source or destination bucket is in Amazon Web Services Local Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent Amazon Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error with the error code `InvalidRequest`.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must use the Outpost bucket access point ARN or the access point alias for the destination bucket. You can only copy objects within the same Outpost bucket. It's not supported to copy objects across different Amazon Web Services Outposts, between buckets on the same Outposts, or between Outposts buckets and any other bucket types. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *S3 on Outposts guide*. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname, in the format `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. The hostname isn't required when you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs.
            bucket-key-enabled: |-
                Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object.

                Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Specifying this header with a COPY action doesn’t affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

                For more information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Directory buckets** - S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
            cache-control: Specifies the caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
            checksum-algorithm: |-
                Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum for the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                When you copy an object, if the source object has a checksum, that checksum value will be copied to the new object by default. If the `CopyObject` request does not include this `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header, the checksum algorithm will be copied from the source object to the destination object (if it's present on the source object). You can optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header. Unrecognized or unsupported values will respond with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.

                For directory buckets, when you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, `CRC32` is the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            content-disposition: Specifies presentational information for the object. Indicates whether an object should be displayed in a web browser or downloaded as a file. It allows specifying the desired filename for the downloaded file.
            content-encoding: |-
                Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

                For directory buckets, only the `aws-chunked` value is supported in this header field.
            content-language: The language the content is in.
            content-type: A standard MIME type that describes the format of the object data.
            copy-source: "Specifies the source object for the copy operation. The source object can be up to 5 GB. If the source object is an object that was uploaded by using a multipart upload, the object copy will be a single part object after the source object is copied to the destination bucket.\n\nYou specify the value of the copy source in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an [access point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):\n\n- For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` from the general purpose bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded. To copy the object `reports/january.pdf` from the directory bucket `awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3`, use `awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.\n- For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL encoded.\n  \n  - Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n  - Access points are not supported by directory buckets.\n  \n  Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.\n\nIf your source bucket versioning is enabled, the `x-amz-copy-source` header by default identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the `versionId` query parameter. Specifically, append `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example, `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`). If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.\n\nIf you enable versioning on the destination bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the copied object. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the `x-amz-version-id` response header in the response.\n\nIf you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the destination bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates in the `x-amz-version-id` response header is always null.\n\n**Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets."

            if-match: |-
                Copies the object if the entity tag (ETag) of the destination object matches the specified tag. If the ETag values do not match, the operation returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. If a concurrent operation occurs during the upload S3 returns a `409 ConditionalRequestConflict` response. On a 409 failure you should fetch the object's ETag and retry the upload.

                Expects the ETag value as a string.

            metadata-directive: |-
                Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or replaced with metadata that's provided in the request. When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (the default) or specify new metadata. If this header isn’t specified, `COPY` is the default behavior.

                **General purpose bucket** - For general purpose buckets, when you grant permissions, you can use the `s3:x-amz-metadata-directive` condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see [Amazon S3 condition key examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                `x-amz-website-redirect-location` is unique to each object and is not copied when using the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. To copy the value, you must specify `x-amz-website-redirect-location` in the request header.

            server-side-encryption: |-
                The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3. Unrecognized or unsupported values won’t write a destination object and will receive a `400 Bad Request` response.

                Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to an S3 bucket. When copying an object, if you don't specify encryption information in your copy request, the encryption setting of the target object is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a different default encryption configuration, Amazon S3 uses the corresponding encryption key to encrypt the target object copy.

                With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes your data to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **General purpose buckets**

                - For general purpose buckets, there are the following supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), and server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy.
                - When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can specify appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence.

                **Directory buckets**

                - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).
                - To encrypt new object copies to a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, we recommend you specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)). The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration. Then, when you perform a `CopyObject` operation and want to specify server-side encryption settings for new object copies with SSE-KMS in the encryption-related request headers, you must ensure the encryption key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption configuration.
                - **S3 access points for Amazon FSx** - When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx.
            sse-customer-algorithm: |-
                Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, `AES256`).

                When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can specify appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence.

                This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.
            sse-customer-key: |-
                Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded. Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.

                This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.
            sse-customer-key-m-d5: |-
                Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

                This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.
            ssekms-encryption-context: |-
                Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for the destination object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.

                **General purpose buckets** - This value must be explicitly added to specify encryption context for `CopyObject` requests if you want an additional encryption context for your destination object. The additional encryption context of the source object won't be copied to the destination object. For more information, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#encryption-context) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Directory buckets** - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
            ssekms-key-id: |-
                Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by KMS will fail if they're not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see [Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Directory buckets** - To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it's recommended to specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms`. Then, the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses the bucket's default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly set the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header, it must match the bucket's default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN, not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket's lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. Incorrect key specification results in an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error.
            storage-class: |-
                If the `x-amz-storage-class` header is not used, the copied object will be stored in the `STANDARD` Storage Class by default. The `STANDARD` storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class.

                - **Directory buckets** - Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones. Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.
                - **Amazon S3 on Outposts** - S3 on Outposts only uses the `OUTPOSTS` Storage Class.

                You can use the `CopyObject` action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 by using the `x-amz-storage-class` header. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Before using an object as a source object for the copy operation, you must restore a copy of it if it meets any of the following conditions:

                - The storage class of the source object is `GLACIER` or `DEEP_ARCHIVE`.
                - The storage class of the source object is `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` and it's [S3 Intelligent-Tiering access tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intelligent-tiering-overview.html#intel-tiering-tier-definition) is `Archive Access` or `Deep Archive Access`.

                For more information, see [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html) and [Copying Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            tagging: |-
                The tag-set for the object copy in the destination bucket. This value must be used in conjunction with the `x-amz-tagging-directive` if you choose `REPLACE` for the `x-amz-tagging-directive`. If you choose `COPY` for the `x-amz-tagging-directive`, you don't need to set the `x-amz-tagging` header, because the tag-set will be copied from the source object directly. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters.

                The default value is the empty value.

                **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, only the empty tag-set is supported. Any requests that attempt to write non-empty tags into directory buckets will receive a `501 Not Implemented` status code. When the destination bucket is a directory bucket, you will receive a `501 Not Implemented` response in any of the following situations:

                - When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from an S3 source object that has non-empty tags.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a source object and set a non-empty value to `x-amz-tagging`.
                - When you don't set the `x-amz-tagging-directive` header and the source object has non-empty tags. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging-directive` is `COPY`.

                Because only the empty tag-set is supported for directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, the following situations are allowed:

                - When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from a directory bucket source object that has no tags to a general purpose bucket. It copies an empty tag-set to the destination object.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a general purpose bucket source object that has non-empty tags and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and don't set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging` is the empty value.
            tagging-directive: |-
                Specifies whether the object tag-set is copied from the source object or replaced with the tag-set that's provided in the request.

                The default value is `COPY`.

                **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, only the empty tag-set is supported. Any requests that attempt to write non-empty tags into directory buckets will receive a `501 Not Implemented` status code. When the destination bucket is a directory bucket, you will receive a `501 Not Implemented` response in any of the following situations:

                - When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from an S3 source object that has non-empty tags.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a source object and set a non-empty value to `x-amz-tagging`.
                - When you don't set the `x-amz-tagging-directive` header and the source object has non-empty tags. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging-directive` is `COPY`.

                Because only the empty tag-set is supported for directory buckets in a `CopyObject` operation, the following situations are allowed:

                - When you attempt to `COPY` the tag-set from a directory bucket source object that has no tags to a general purpose bucket. It copies an empty tag-set to the destination object.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a general purpose bucket source object that has non-empty tags and set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object to empty.
                - When you attempt to `REPLACE` the tag-set of a directory bucket source object and don't set the `x-amz-tagging` value of the directory bucket destination object. This is because the default value of `x-amz-tagging` is the empty value.
            website-redirect-location: |-
                If the destination bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object copy to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. This value is unique to each object and is not copied when using the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. Instead, you may opt to provide this header in combination with the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
            - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the `s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            - [GetBucketEncryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketEncryption.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            bucket: |-
                The name of the bucket containing the server-side encryption configuration to delete.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3`).

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            This implementation of the `GET` action uses the `acl` subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use `GET` to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have the `READ_ACP` access to the bucket. If `READ_ACP` permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

            When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

            When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

            If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see [Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

        command: "Retrieves an object from Amazon S3.\n\nIn the `GetObject` request, specify the full key name for the object.\n\n**General purpose buckets** - Both the virtual-hosted-style requests and the path-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`, specify the object key name as `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For a path-style request example, if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket named `examplebucket`, specify the object key name as `/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For more information about request types, see [HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory buckets** - Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`, specify the object key name as `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the required permissions in a policy. To use `GetObject`, you must have the `READ` access to the object (or version). If you grant `READ` access to the anonymous user, the `GetObject` operation returns the object without using an authorization header. For more information, see [Specifying permissions in a policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  If you include a `versionId` in your request header, you must have the `s3:GetObjectVersion` permission to access a specific version of an object. The `s3:GetObject` permission is not required in this scenario.\n  \n  If you request the current version of an object without a specific `versionId` in the request header, only the `s3:GetObject` permission is required. The `s3:GetObjectVersion` permission is not required in this scenario.\n  \n  If the object that you request doesn’t exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.\n  \n  - If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found` error.\n  - If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Access Denied` error.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If the object is encrypted using SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nStorage classes\n\nIf the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html). Otherwise, this operation returns an `InvalidObjectState` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see [Restoring Archived Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory buckets** - Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones. Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for the `GetObject` requests, if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your `GetObject` requests for the object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error.\n\n**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nOverriding response header values through the request\n\nThere are times when you want to override certain response header values of a `GetObject` response. For example, you might override the `Content-Disposition` response header value through your `GetObject` request.\n\nYou can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response header values are included only in a successful response, that is, when the HTTP status code `200 OK` is returned. The headers you can override using the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object.\n\nThe response headers that you can override for the `GetObject` response are `Cache-Control`, `Content-Disposition`, `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, and `Expires`.\n\nTo override values for a set of response headers in the `GetObject` response, you can use the following query parameters in the request.\n\n- `response-cache-control`\n- `response-content-disposition`\n- `response-content-encoding`\n- `response-content-language`\n- `response-content-type`\n- `response-expires`\n\nWhen you use these parameters, you must sign the request by using either an Authorization header or a presigned URL. These parameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `GetObject`:\n\n- [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html)\n- [GetObjectAcl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."
        flag:
            bucket: |-
                The bucket name containing the object.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Object Lambda access points** - When you use this action with an Object Lambda access point, you must direct requests to the Object Lambda access point hostname. The Object Lambda access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-object-lambda.*Region*.amazonaws.com.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            sse-customer-algorithm: |-
                Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the object (for example, `AES256`).

                If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

                For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            sse-customer-key: |-
                Specifies the customer-provided encryption key that you originally provided for Amazon S3 to encrypt the data before storing it. This value is used to decrypt the object when recovering it and must match the one used when storing the data. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.

                If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

                For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            sse-customer-key-m-d5: |-
                Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

                If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
                - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

                For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            version-id: |-
                Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

                By default, the `GetObject` operation returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the `versionId` subresource.

                - If you include a `versionId` in your request header, you must have the `s3:GetObjectVersion` permission to access a specific version of an object. The `s3:GetObject` permission is not required in this scenario.
                - If you request the current version of an object without a specific `versionId` in the request header, only the `s3:GetObject` permission is required. The `s3:GetObjectVersion` permission is not required in this scenario.
                - **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.

                For more information about versioning, see [PutBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html).

      documentation:
        command: "End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).\n\nThis action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nAfter you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.\n\nIf you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the created multipart upload must be completed within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see [Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config).\n\n- **Directory buckets** - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nRequest signing\n\nFor request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n\nEncryption\n\n- **General purpose buckets** - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) requests must match the headers you used in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request.\n  \n  - Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.\n    \n    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption`\n    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`\n    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`\n    \n    <!--THE END-->\n    \n    - If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3` key) in KMS to protect the data.\n    - To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n    - If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role is in a different account from the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.\n    - All `GET` and `PUT` requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don't make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4. For information about configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see [Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n    \n    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  - Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.\n    \n    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n    \n    For more information about server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n  \n  In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You can't override the values of the encryption settings (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`) that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession` request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.\n  \n  When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the `CreateSession` request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the `CreateSession` request. So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)), the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.\n  \n  For directory buckets, when you perform a `CreateMultipartUpload` operation and an `UploadPartCopy` operation, the request headers you provide in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `CreateMultipartUpload`:\n\n- [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n- [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n- [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."
        flag:
            acl: |-
                The canned ACL to apply to the object. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When uploading an object, you can grant access permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the new object. For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html). One way to grant the permissions using the request headers is to specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header.

                - This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
                - This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
            bucket: |-
                The name of the bucket where the multipart upload is initiated and where the object is uploaded.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            bucket-key-enabled: |-
                Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).

                **General purpose buckets** - Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Also, specifying this header with a PUT action doesn't affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

                **Directory buckets** - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html), [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html), [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops), or [the import jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
            cache-control: Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
            checksum-algorithm: Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum for the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            checksum-type: Indicates the checksum type that you want Amazon S3 to use to calculate the object’s checksum value. For more information, see [Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html).

            server-side-encryption: "The server-side encryption algorithm used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.\n\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n  \n  In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You can't override the values of the encryption settings (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`) that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession` request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.\n  \n  When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the `CreateSession` request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the `CreateSession` request. So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)), the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.\n- **S3 access points for Amazon FSx** - When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx."
            sse-customer-algorithm: |-
                Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            sse-customer-key: |-
                Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            sse-customer-key-m-d5: |-
                Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            ssekms-encryption-context: |-
                Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs.

                **Directory buckets** - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
            ssekms-key-id: |-
                Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.

                **General purpose buckets** - If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption` with `aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS key to use. If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms` or `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, but do not provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) to protect the data.

                **Directory buckets** - To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it's recommended to specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms`. Then, the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses the bucket's default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly set the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header, it must match the bucket's default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN, not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket's lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. Incorrect key specification results in an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error.
            storage-class: |-
                By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                - Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Puts a S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket. You can have up to 1,000 S3 Intelligent-Tiering configurations per bucket.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

            This implementation of the `PUT` action adds an S3 Inventory configuration (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.

            Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is inventoried is called the *source* bucket, and the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the *destination* bucket. The *destination* bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the *source* bucket.

            When you configure an inventory for a *source* bucket, you specify the *destination* bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current versions. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

            You must create a bucket policy on the *destination* bucket to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an example policy, see [Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9).

            Permissions

            To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.

            The `s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` permission allows a user to create an [S3 Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html) report that includes all object metadata fields available and to specify the destination bucket to store the inventory. A user with read access to objects in the destination bucket can also access all object metadata fields that are available in the inventory report.

            To restrict access to an inventory report, see [Restricting access to an Amazon S3 Inventory report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-10) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Permissions

            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have the `DeleteBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

            If you don't have `DeleteBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

            To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon Web Services account can perform the `GetBucketPolicy`, `PutBucketPolicy`, and `DeleteBucketPolicy` API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.

            - **General purpose bucket permissions** - The `s3:DeleteBucketPolicy` permission is required in a policy. For more information about general purpose buckets bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the `s3express:DeleteBucketPolicy` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a `200 OK` response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a `200 OK` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a `404` response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.

            This DELETE action requires the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission.

            For more information about hosting websites, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

            End of support notice: Beginning November 21, 2025, Amazon S3 will stop returning `DisplayName`. Update your applications to use canonical IDs (unique identifier for Amazon Web Services accounts), Amazon Web Services account ID (12 digit identifier) or IAM ARNs (full resource naming) as a direct replacement of `DisplayName`.

            This change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia) Region, US West (N. California) Region, US West (Oregon) Region, Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region, Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, Europe (Ireland) Region, and South America (São Paulo) Region.

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Be sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

            This action has been revised. We recommend that you use the newer version, [ListObjectsV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html), when developing applications. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support `ListObjects`.

            The following operations are related to `ListObjects`:

            - [ListObjectsV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html)
            - [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)
            - [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)

            - [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            bucket: |-
                The name of the bucket containing the objects.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-keys: Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.
            optional-object-attributes: Specifies the optional fields that you want returned in the response. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to support fast authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint API operations on directory buckets. For more information about Zonal endpoint API operations that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see [S3 Express One Zone APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-APIs.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the `CreateSession` API operation. Specifically, you grant `s3express:CreateSession` permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the `CreateSession` API request on the bucket, which returns temporary security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token, and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal endpoint API operations. After the session is created, you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You also apply the session token to the `x-amz-s3session-token` request header for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a `CreateSession` API request that generates a new set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified interval.

            If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more information, see [Performance guidelines and design patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-optimizing-performance-guidelines-design-patterns.html#s3-express-optimizing-performance-session-authentication) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            - You must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            - **`CopyObject` API operation** - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the `CopyObject` API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the `CreateSession` API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the `CopyObject` API operation on directory buckets, see [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html).
            - **`HeadBucket` API operation** - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the `HeadBucket` API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the `CreateSession` API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the `HeadBucket` API operation on directory buckets, see [HeadBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html).

            Permissions

            To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to control who can create a `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly` session. For more information about `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly` sessions, see [`x-amz-create-session-mode`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html#API_CreateSession_RequestParameters) . For example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html) and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint API operations, the bucket policy should also grant both accounts the `s3express:CreateSession` permission.

            If you want to encrypt objects with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and the `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.

            Encryption

            For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).

            For [Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-differences.html#s3-express-differences-api-operations) except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html), you authenticate and authorize requests through [CreateSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) for low latency. To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)). Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session.

            Only 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) is supported per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. After you specify SSE-KMS as your bucket's default encryption configuration with a customer managed key, you can't change the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.

            In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)) using the REST API, you can't override the values of the encryption settings (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`) from the `CreateSession` request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession` request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.

            When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the `CreateSession` request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the `CreateSession` request. Also, in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)), it's not supported to override the values of the encryption settings from the `CreateSession` request.

            HTTP Host header syntax

            **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

                S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html), [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html), [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops), or [the import jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.

By default, Amazon S3 encrypts data with SSE-S3. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **S3 access points for Amazon FSx** - When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx.
            session-mode: 'Specifies the mode of the session that will be created, either `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly`. By default, a `ReadWrite` session is created. A `ReadWrite` session is capable of executing all the Zonal endpoint API operations on a directory bucket. A `ReadOnly` session is constrained to execute the following Zonal endpoint API operations: `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `ListObjectsV2`, `GetObjectAttributes`, `ListParts`, and `ListMultipartUploads`.'

This value is stored as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web Services KMS for future `GetObject` operations on this object.

                **General purpose buckets** - This value must be explicitly added during `CopyObject` operations if you want an additional encryption context for your object. For more information, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#encryption-context) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Directory buckets** - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
            ssekms-key-id: |-
                If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption` with `aws:kms`, you must specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS symmetric encryption customer managed key to use. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported. Also, if the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that't issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.

                Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket's lifetime.

            Using the `GetBucketLocation` operation is no longer a best practice. To return the Region that a bucket resides in, we recommend that you use the [HeadBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html) operation instead. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the `GetBucketLocation` operation.

            Returns the Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region using the `LocationConstraint` request parameter in a `CreateBucket` request. For more information, see [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html).

            In a bucket's home Region, calls to the `GetBucketLocation` operation are governed by the bucket's policy. In other Regions, the bucket policy doesn't apply, which means that cross-account access won't be authorized. However, calls to the `HeadBucket` operation always return the bucket’s location through an HTTP response header, whether access to the bucket is authorized or not. Therefore, we recommend using the `HeadBucket` operation for bucket Region discovery and to avoid using the `GetBucketLocation` operation.

            When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

            When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

            - [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.

            To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

            The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two values:

            - Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.
            - Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

            The [GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html) action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.

            After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.

            The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (".").

            For more information about transfer acceleration, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html).

            Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For more information, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information. You can invoke this request for a specific Amazon Web Services Region by using the [`aws:RequestedRegion`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-requestedregion) condition key.

            A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

            To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and `Priority`.

            If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see [Backward Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations).

            For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see [Using Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html).

            Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects

            By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: `SourceSelectionCriteria`, `SseKmsEncryptedObjects`, `Status`, `EncryptionConfiguration`, and `ReplicaKmsKeyID`. For information about replication configuration, see [Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html).

            For information on `PutBucketReplication` errors, see [List of replication-related error codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList)

            Permissions

            To create a `PutBucketReplication` request, you must have `s3:PutReplicationConfiguration` permissions for the bucket.

            By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

            To perform this operation, the user or role performing the action must have the [iam:PassRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html) permission.

            The following operations are related to `PutBucketReplication`:

            - [GetBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketReplication.html)
            - [DeleteBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketReplication.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

            For tagging-related restrictions related to characters and encodings, see [Tag Restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html). Note that Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 10 tags per object.

            To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:PutObjectTagging` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

            To put tags of any other version, use the `versionId` query parameter. You also need permission for the `s3:PutObjectVersionTagging` action.

            `PutObjectTagging` has the following special errors. For more Amazon S3 errors see, [Error Responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html).

            - `InvalidTag` - The tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can occur if the tag did not pass input validation. For more information, see [Object Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html).

        command: "The `HEAD` operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.\n\nA `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` operation on an object. The response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as `400 Bad Request`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `405 Method Not Allowed`, `412 Precondition Failed`, or `304 Not Modified`. It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.\n\nRequest headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html).\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - To use `HEAD`, you must have the `s3:GetObject` permission. You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.\n  \n  - If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found` error.\n  - If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` error.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If you enable `x-amz-checksum-mode` in the request and the object is encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a `HEAD` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.\n\nIf you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:\n\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\nFor more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory bucket** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nVersioning\n\n- If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.\n- If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error and the `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- **Directory buckets** - Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.\n- **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nFor directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nThe following actions are related to `HeadObject`:\n\n- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n- [GetObjectAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

You obtain this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html).\n\nThe `ListParts` request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The limit of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts in a response by specifying the `max-parts` request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an `IsTruncated` field with the value of `true`, and a `NextPartNumberMarker` element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent `ListParts` requests, include the `part-number-marker` query string parameter and set its value to the `NextPartNumberMarker` field value from the previous response.\n\nFor more information on multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `ListParts`:\n\n- [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n- [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n- [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n- [GetObjectAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html)\n- [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html). To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the `WRITE_ACP` permission.\n\nYou can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:\n\n- Specify the ACL in the request body\n- Specify permissions using request headers\n\nYou cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.\n\nIf your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see [Controlling object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\nYou can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:\n\n- Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-acl`. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).\n- Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the `x-amz-acl` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).\n  \n  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:\n  \n  - `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n  - `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group\n  - `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n    \n    Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n    \n    - US East (N. Virginia)\n    - US West (N.

In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.\n\nFor conceptual information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be signed. For more information, see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html).\n\n**Directory buckets** - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the `UploadPartCopy` API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API operation.\n\nAmazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.\n\nPermissions\n\nYou must have `READ` access to the source object and `WRITE` access to the destination bucket.\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination bucket in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.\n  \n  - If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:GetObject`** permission to read the source object that is being copied.\n  - If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:PutObject`** permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.\n  - To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) and [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.\n  \n  - If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the copy source bucket.\n  - If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The `s3express:SessionMode` condition key cannot be set to `ReadOnly` on the copy destination.\n  \n  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n  \n  For example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html) and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nEncryption\n\n- **General purpose buckets** - For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the `UploadPartCopy` operation, see [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html).\n  \n  If you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) blocked for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access Denied error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new data to your bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html).\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  For directory buckets, when you perform a `CreateMultipartUpload` operation and an `UploadPartCopy` operation, the request headers you provide in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.\n  \n  S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.\n\nSpecial errors\n\n- Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`\n  \n  - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found\n- Error Code: `InvalidRequest`\n  \n  - Description: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `UploadPartCopy`:\n\n- [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n- [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n- [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n- [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

                The bucket name.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Copying objects across different Amazon Web Services Regions isn't supported when the source or destination bucket is in Amazon Web Services Local Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent Amazon Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error with the error code `InvalidRequest`.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an [access point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):\n\n- For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.\n- For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL encoded.\n  \n  - Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n  - Access points are not supported by directory buckets.\n  \n  Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`. For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL-encoded.\n\nIf your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of the source object to copy. To copy a specific version of the source object to copy, append `?versionId=<version-id>` to the `x-amz-copy-source` request header (for example, `x-amz-copy-source: /awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).\n\nIf the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source` request header, Amazon S3 returns a `404 Not Found` error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source` and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the `x-amz-copy-source`.\n\n**Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets."

            Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

            Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event notifications, see [Configuring Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).

            Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type.

            By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty `NotificationConfiguration`.

            `<NotificationConfiguration>`

            `</NotificationConfiguration>`

            This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request body.

            After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).

            You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element.

            For more information about the number of event notification configurations that you can create per bucket, see [Amazon S3 service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#limits_s3) in *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

            By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with the required `s3:PutBucketNotification` permission.

            The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.

            If the configuration in the request body includes only one `TopicConfiguration` specifying only the `s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject` event type, the response will also include the `x-amz-sns-test-message-id` header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

            If you don't have `GetBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

            To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon Web Services account can perform the `GetBucketPolicy`, `PutBucketPolicy`, and `DeleteBucketPolicy` API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.

            - **General purpose bucket permissions** - The `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission is required in a policy. For more information about general purpose buckets bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the `s3express:GetBucketPolicy` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            HTTP Host header syntax

            **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

            The following action is related to `GetBucketPolicy`:

            - [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            bucket: |-
                The bucket name to get the bucket policy for.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

                **Access points** - When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

                **Object Lambda access points** - When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

A `200 OK` response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. For more information about listing objects, see [Listing object keys programmatically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ListingKeysUsingAPIs.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. To get a list of your buckets, see [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html).

            - **General purpose bucket** - For general purpose buckets, `ListObjectsV2` doesn't return prefixes that are related only to in-progress multipart uploads.
            - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, `ListObjectsV2` response includes the prefixes that are related only to in-progress multipart uploads.
            - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Permissions

            - **General purpose bucket permissions** - To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket. You must have permission to perform the `s3:ListBucket` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .

            Sorting order of returned objects

            - **General purpose bucket** - For general purpose buckets, `ListObjectsV2` returns objects in lexicographical order based on their key names.
            - **Directory bucket** - For directory buckets, `ListObjectsV2` does not return objects in lexicographical order.

            HTTP Host header syntax

            **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

            This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recommend that you use this revised API operation for application development. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the prior version of this API operation, [ListObjects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjects.html).

            The following operations are related to `ListObjectsV2`:

            - [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)
            - [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)
            - [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            bucket: |-
                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            delimiter: |-
                A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.

                `CommonPrefixes` is filtered out from results if it is not lexicographically greater than the `StartAfter` value.

                - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, `/` is the only supported delimiter.
                - **Directory buckets** - When you query `ListObjectsV2` with a delimiter during in-progress multipart uploads, the `CommonPrefixes` response parameter contains the prefixes that are associated with the in-progress multipart uploads. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            encoding-type: |-
                Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the [object keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html) in the response. Responses are encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see [Object key naming guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines).

                When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object `test_file(3).png` will appear as `test_file%283%29.png`.
            expected-bucket-owner: The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).
            fetch-owner: |-
                The owner field is not present in `ListObjectsV2` by default. If you want to return the owner field with each key in the result, then set the `FetchOwner` field to `true`.

                **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, the bucket owner is returned as the object owner for all objects.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-keys: Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.
            optional-object-attributes: |-
                Specifies the optional fields that you want returned in the response. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            prefix: |-
                Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

                **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in a delimiter (`/`) are supported.
            request-payer: |-
                Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            start-after: |-
                StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3 starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter can be any key in the bucket.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Renames an existing object in a directory bucket that uses the S3 Express One Zone storage class. You can use `RenameObject` by specifying an existing object’s name as the source and the new name of the object as the destination within the same directory bucket.

            `RenameObject` is only supported for objects stored in the S3 Express One Zone storage class.

            To prevent overwriting an object, you can use the `If-None-Match` conditional header.

            - **If-None-Match** - Renames the object only if an object with the specified name does not already exist in the directory bucket. If you don't want to overwrite an existing object, you can add the `If-None-Match` conditional header with the value `‘*’` in the `RenameObject` request. Amazon S3 then returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error if the object with the specified name already exists. For more information, see [RFC 7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7232/).

            Permissions

            To grant access to the `RenameObject` operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `CreateSession` operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the directory bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. The Amazon Web Services CLI and SDKs will create and manage your session including refreshing the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. In your bucket policy, you can specify the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to control who can create a `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly` session. A `ReadWrite` session is required for executing all the Zonal endpoint API operations, including `RenameObject`. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) . To learn more about Zonal endpoint API operations, see [Authorizing Zonal endpoint API operations with CreateSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-create-session.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            HTTP Host header syntax

            **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

                You must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

You should not reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you retry a request that completed successfully using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions. If you retry a successful request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry fails and an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error is returned.

The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.

For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.\n\nTo restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.\n\nWhen restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the `Tier` element of the request body:\n\n- `Expedited` - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.\n- `Standard` - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.\n- `Bulk` - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.\n\nFor more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for `Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nYou can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see [Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nTo get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD` request. Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nAfter restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.\n\nIf your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html) and [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nResponses\n\nA successful action returns either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted` status code.\n\n- If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns `202 Accepted` in the response.\n- If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` in the response.\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- Special errors:\n  \n  - *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*\n  - *Cause: Object restore is already in progress.*\n  - *HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict*\n  - *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client*\n- - *Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable*\n  - *Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not available.

            This implementation of the GET action uses the `accelerate` subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either `Enabled` or `Suspended`. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.

            To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to `Enabled` or `Suspended` by using the [PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html) operation.

            A GET `accelerate` request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.

            For more information about transfer acceleration, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

            Deletes the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body.\n\nWhen performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see [MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory buckets** - MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - The following permissions are required in your policies when your `DeleteObjects` request includes specific headers.\n  \n  - **`s3:DeleteObject`** - To delete an object from a bucket, you must always specify the `s3:DeleteObject` permission.\n  - **`s3:DeleteObjectVersion`** - To delete a specific version of an object from a versioning-enabled bucket, you must specify the `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` permission.\n    \n    If the `s3:DeleteObject` or `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` permissions are explicitly denied in your bucket policy, attempts to delete any unversioned objects result in a `403 Access Denied` error.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n\nContent-MD5 request header\n\n- **General purpose bucket** - The Content-MD5 request header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.\n- **Directory bucket** - The Content-MD5 request header or a additional checksum request header (including `x-amz-checksum-crc32`, `x-amz-checksum-crc32c`, `x-amz-checksum-sha1`, or `x-amz-checksum-sha256`) is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `DeleteObjects`:\n\n- [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n- [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n- [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."
        flag:
            bucket: |-
                The bucket name containing the objects to delete.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            checksum-algorithm: |-
                Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` or `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.

                For the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header, replace `algorithm` with the supported algorithm from the following list:

                - `CRC32`
                - `CRC32C`
                - `CRC64NVME`
                - `SHA1`
                - `SHA256`

                For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                If the individual checksum value you provide through `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` doesn't match the checksum algorithm you set through `x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm`, Amazon S3 fails the request with a `BadDigest` error.

                If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm` parameter.

Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a `GET` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.\n\nIf you encrypted an object when you stored the object in Amazon S3 by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers. These headers provide the server with the encryption key required to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:\n\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\nFor more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory bucket permissions** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n\nVersioning\n\n**Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n\nConditional request headers\n\nConsider the following when using request headers:\n\n- If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code `200 OK` and the data requested:\n  \n  - `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`.\n  - `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`.\n  \n  For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).\n- If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code `304 Not Modified`:\n  \n  - `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`.\n  - `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`.\n  \n  For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following actions are related to `GetObjectAttributes`:\n\n- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n- [GetObjectAcl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html)\n- [GetObjectLegalHold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectLegalHold.html)\n- [GetObjectLockConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectLockConfiguration.html)\n- [GetObjectRetention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectRetention.html)\n- [GetObjectTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html)\n- [HeadObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadObject.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

            Retrieves the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html).

            When Amazon S3 evaluates the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the `PublicAccessBlock` settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

            For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see [The Meaning of "Public"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status).

For more information about permissions, see [Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have the **`s3express:CreateSession`** permission in the `Action` element of a policy. By default, the session is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on the bucket.\n  \n  For more information about example bucket policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html) and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nYou must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

                The bucket name.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Object Lambda access points** - When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).\n\nThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.\n\nUses the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have the `WRITE_ACP` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see [What permissions can I grant?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nThis functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nIf your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see [Controlling object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\nYou can set access permissions using one of the following methods:\n\n- Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-ac`l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).\n- Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use `x-amz-acl` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).\n  \n  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:\n  \n  - `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n  - `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group\n  - `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n    \n    Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n    \n    - US East (N. Virginia)\n    - US West (N. California)\n    - US West (Oregon)\n    - Asia Pacific (Singapore)\n    - Asia Pacific (Sydney)\n    - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)\n    - Europe (Ireland)\n    - South America (São Paulo)\n    \n    For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n  \n  For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.\n  \n  `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\"`\n\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\n\nGrantee Values\n\nYou can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways. For examples of how to specify these grantee values in JSON format, see the Amazon Web Services CLI example in [Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n- By the person's ID:\n  \n  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"CanonicalUser\"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>`\n  \n  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.\n- By URI:\n  \n  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"Group\"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`\n- By Email address:\n  \n  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"AmazonCustomerByEmail\"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`\n  \n  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.\n  \n  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n  \n  - US East (N. Virginia)\n  - US West (N. California)\n  - US West (Oregon)\n  - Asia Pacific (Singapore)\n  - Asia Pacific (Sydney)\n  - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)\n  - Europe (Ireland)\n  - South America (São Paulo)\n  \n  For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nVersioning\n\nThe ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the `versionId` subresource.\n\nThe following operations are related to `PutObjectAcl`:\n\n- [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\n- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

            Permissions

            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have the `PutBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

            If you don't have `PutBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

            To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon Web Services account can perform the `GetBucketPolicy`, `PutBucketPolicy`, and `DeleteBucketPolicy` API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.

            - **General purpose bucket permissions** - The `s3:PutBucketPolicy` permission is required in a policy. For more information about general purpose buckets bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        command: "End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).\n\nAdds an object to a bucket.\n\n- Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. You cannot use `PutObject` to only update a single piece of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire object with updated metadata if you want to update some values.\n- If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. All objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nAmazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides features that can modify this behavior:\n\n- **S3 Object Lock** - To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use [Amazon S3 Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.\n- **If-None-Match** - Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in the specified bucket. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. If a conflicting operation occurs during the upload, S3 returns a `409 ConditionalRequestConflict` response. On a 409 failure, retry the upload.\n  \n  Expects the * character (asterisk).\n  \n  For more information, see [Add preconditions to S3 operations with conditional requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/conditional-requests.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* or [RFC 7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7232/).\n  \n  This functionality is not supported for S3 on Outposts.\n- **S3 Versioning** - When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all versions of the objects. For each write request that is made to the same object, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that object being stored in Amazon S3. You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the object. For more information about versioning, see [Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html).\n  \n  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - The following permissions are required in your policies when your `PutObject` request includes specific headers.\n  \n  - **`s3:PutObject`** - To successfully complete the `PutObject` request, you must always have the `s3:PutObject` permission on a bucket to add an object to it.\n  - **`s3:PutObjectAcl`** - To successfully change the objects ACL of your `PutObject` request, you must have the `s3:PutObjectAcl`.\n  - **`s3:PutObjectTagging`** - To successfully set the tag-set with your `PutObject` request, you must have the `s3:PutObjectTagging`.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nData integrity with Content-MD5\n\n- **General purpose bucket** - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the `Content-MD5` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. Alternatively, when the object's ETag is its MD5 digest, you can calculate the MD5 while putting the object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.\n- **Directory bucket** - This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nFor more information about related Amazon S3 APIs, see the following:\n\n- [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\n- [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."
        flag:
            acl: |-
                The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                When adding a new object, you can use headers to grant ACL-based permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) and [Managing ACLs Using the REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a `400` error with the error code `AccessControlListNotSupported`. For more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                - This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
                - This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
            body: Object data.
            bucket: |-
                The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            bucket-key-enabled: |-
                Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).

                **General purpose buckets** - Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Also, specifying this header with a PUT action doesn't affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

                **Directory buckets** - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html), [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html), [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops), or [the import jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
            cache-control: Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain. For more information, see [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9).
            checksum-algorithm: |-
                Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` or `x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`.

                For the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header, replace `algorithm` with the supported algorithm from the following list:

                - `CRC32`
                - `CRC32C`
                - `CRC64NVME`
                - `SHA1`
                - `SHA256`

                For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                If the individual checksum value you provide through `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` doesn't match the checksum algorithm you set through `x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm`, Amazon S3 fails the request with a `BadDigest` error.

                The `Content-MD5` or `x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm` header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information, see [Uploading objects to an Object Lock enabled bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-managing.html#object-lock-put-object) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                For directory buckets, when you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, `CRC32` is the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.
            checksum-cr-c32: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32` checksum of the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            checksum-cr-c32-c: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
            checksum-cr-c64-nvme: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME` checksum of the object. The `CRC64NVME` checksum is always a full object checksum. For more information, see [Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html).
            checksum-sh-a1: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` digest of the object.

            server-side-encryption: "The server-side encryption algorithm that was used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.\n\n- **General purpose buckets** - You have four mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n  \n  In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You can't override the values of the encryption settings (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`) that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession` request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.\n  \n  When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the `CreateSession` request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the `CreateSession` request. So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)), the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.\n- **S3 access points for Amazon FSx** - When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx."
            sse-customer-algorithm: |-
                Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, `AES256`).

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            sse-customer-key: |-
                Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            sse-customer-key-m-d5: |-
                Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            ssekms-encryption-context: |-
                Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. This value is stored as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web Services KMS for future `GetObject` operations on this object.

                **General purpose buckets** - This value must be explicitly added during `CopyObject` operations if you want an additional encryption context for your object. For more information, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#encryption-context) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Directory buckets** - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
            ssekms-key-id: |-
                Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.

                **General purpose buckets** - If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption` with `aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS key to use. If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms` or `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, but do not provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) to protect the data.

                **Directory buckets** - To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it's recommended to specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms`. Then, the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses the bucket's default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly set the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header, it must match the bucket's default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN, not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket's lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. Incorrect key specification results in an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error.
            storage-class: |-
                By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                - Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.
                - Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.
            tagging: |-
                The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")

                This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
            website-redirect-location: |-
                If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see [Object Key and Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

                `x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html`

                In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:

                `x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/`

                For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) and [How to Configure Website Page Redirects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            write-offset-bytes: |-
                Specifies the offset for appending data to existing objects in bytes. The offset must be equal to the size of the existing object being appended to. If no object exists, setting this header to 0 will create a new object.

                This functionality is only supported for objects in the Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class in directory buckets.

            Creates or modifies the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html).

            When Amazon S3 evaluates the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the `PublicAccessBlock` configurations are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

            For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see [The Meaning of "Public"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status).

        command: "End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).\n\nThis action creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see [`CreateBucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html) .\n\nCreates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.\n\nThere are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about these bucket types, see [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n- **General purpose buckets** - If you send your `CreateBucket` request to the `s3.amazonaws.com` global endpoint, the request goes to the `us-east-1` Region. So the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use `us-east-1` as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - In addition to the `s3:CreateBucket` permission, the following permissions are required in a policy when your `CreateBucket` request includes specific headers:\n  \n  - **Access control lists (ACLs)** - In your `CreateBucket` request, if you specify an access control list (ACL) and set it to `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read`, or if you explicitly specify any other custom ACLs, both `s3:CreateBucket` and `s3:PutBucketAcl` permissions are required. In your `CreateBucket` request, if you set the ACL to `private`, or if you don't specify any ACLs, only the `s3:CreateBucket` permission is required.\n  - **Object Lock** - In your `CreateBucket` request, if you set `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled` to true, the `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration` and `s3:PutBucketVersioning` permissions are required.\n  - **S3 Object Ownership** - If your `CreateBucket` request includes the `x-amz-object-ownership` header, then the `s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls` permission is required.\n    \n    To set an ACL on a bucket as part of a `CreateBucket` request, you must explicitly set S3 Object Ownership for the bucket to a different value than the default, `BucketOwnerEnforced`. Additionally, if your desired bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then explicitly disable Block Public Access on the bucket before using `PutBucketAcl` to set the ACL. If you try to create a bucket with a public ACL, the request will fail.\n    \n    For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep all Block Public Access settings enabled and keep ACLs disabled. If you would like to share data with users outside of your account, you can use bucket policies as needed. For more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) and [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  - **S3 Block Public Access** - If your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources, you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can create a new bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately call the [`DeletePublicAccessBlock`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeletePublicAccessBlock.html) API. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have the `s3express:CreateBucket` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  The permissions for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership, and S3 Block Public Access are not supported for directory buckets. For directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled at the bucket level and S3 Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified.\n  \n  For more information about permissions for creating and working with directory buckets, see [Directory buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about supported S3 features for directory buckets, see [Features of S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-one-zone.html#s3-express-features) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `CreateBucket`:\n\n- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)\n- [DeleteBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

        command: "This operation configures default encryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Keys for an existing bucket. You can also [block encryption types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_BlockedEncryptionTypes.html) using this operation.\n\n**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nBy default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).\n\n- **General purpose buckets**\n  \n  - You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also configure [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html). For information about the bucket default encryption feature, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  - If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your [default bucket encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html) to SSE-KMS, you should verify that your KMS key ID is correct. Amazon S3 doesn't validate the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.\n- **Directory buckets** - You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).\n  \n  - We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n  - Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket's lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) (`aws/s3`) isn't supported.\n  - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html), [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html), [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops), or [the import jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.\n  - When you specify an [KMS customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.\n  - For directory buckets, if you use PutBucketEncryption to set your [default bucket encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html) to SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 validates the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.\n\nIf you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.\n\nAlso, this action requires Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For more information, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - The `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` permission is required in a policy. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the `s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  To set a directory bucket default encryption with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and the `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `PutBucketEncryption`:\n\n- [GetBucketEncryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketEncryption.html)\n- [DeleteBucketEncryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketEncryption.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

                Specifies default encryption for a bucket using server-side encryption with different key options.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            Passes transformed objects to a `GetObject` operation when using Object Lambda access points. For information about Object Lambda access points, see [Transforming objects with Object Lambda access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transforming-objects.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            This operation supports metadata that can be returned by [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html), in addition to `RequestRoute`, `RequestToken`, `StatusCode`, `ErrorCode`, and `ErrorMessage`. The `GetObject` response metadata is supported so that the `WriteGetObjectResponse` caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes `GetObject`. When `WriteGetObjectResponse` is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user `GetObject` call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return.

            You can include any number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header, it should be prefaced with `x-amz-meta`. For example, `x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue`. The primary use case for this is to forward `GetObject` metadata.

            Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web Services Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access point.

            Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

            Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

            Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.

            For information on how to view and use these functions, see [Using Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/olap-examples.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            accept-ranges: Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

            checksum-cr-c32: |-
                This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.

Expiring of versioned objects,transitions and tag filters are not supported.\n\nA lifecycle rule consists of the following:\n\n- A filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, object size, or any combination of these.\n- A status indicating whether the rule is in effect.\n- One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions.\n\nFor more information, see [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) and [Lifecycle Configuration Elements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html).\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration).

The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must have the `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission.\n  \n  You can also explicitly deny permissions. An explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:\n  \n  - `s3:DeleteObject`\n  - `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`\n  - `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`\n    \n    For more information about permissions, see [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have the `s3express:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission in an IAM identity-based policy to use this operation.

            Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the `website` subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

            This PUT action requires the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission.

            To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide index document name for the bucket.

            - `WebsiteConfiguration`
            - `RedirectAllRequestsTo`
            - `HostName`
            - `Protocol`

            If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the redirect destination. In this case, the website configuration must provide an index document for the bucket, because some requests might not be redirected.

            - `WebsiteConfiguration`
            - `IndexDocument`
            - `Suffix`
            - `ErrorDocument`
            - `Key`
            - `RoutingRules`
            - `RoutingRule`
            - `Condition`
            - `HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`
            - `KeyPrefixEquals`
            - `Redirect`
            - `Protocol`
            - `HostName`
            - `ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`
            - `ReplaceKeyWith`
            - `HttpRedirectCode`

            Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per website configuration. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object redirect. For more information, see [Configuring an Object Redirect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            We strongly recommend using only paginated `ListBuckets` requests. Unpaginated `ListBuckets` requests are only supported for Amazon Web Services accounts set to the default general purpose bucket quota of 10,000. If you have an approved general purpose bucket quota above 10,000, you must send paginated `ListBuckets` requests to list your account’s buckets. All unpaginated `ListBuckets` requests will be rejected for Amazon Web Services accounts with a general purpose bucket quota greater than 10,000.

To permanently delete an object in a versioned bucket, you must include the object’s `versionId` in the request. For more information about versioning-enabled buckets, see [Deleting object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DeletingObjectVersions.html).\n- If bucket versioning is suspended, the operation removes the object that has a null `versionId`, if there is one, and inserts a delete marker that becomes the current version of the object. If there isn't an object with a null `versionId`, and all versions of the object have a `versionId`, Amazon S3 does not remove the object and only inserts a delete marker. To permanently delete an object that has a `versionId`, you must include the object’s `versionId` in the request.

For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

Using this query parameter permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header `x-amz-delete-marker` to true.\n\nIf the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the `x-amz-mfa` request header in the DELETE `versionId` request. Requests that include `x-amz-mfa` must use HTTPS. For more information about MFA Delete, see [Using MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following action is related to `DeleteObject`:\n\n- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/analytics-storage-class.html).

            You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket. For an example policy, see [Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9).

            To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

            `PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration` has the following special errors:

            This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

            When you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might take a short amount of time for the change to be fully propagated. While this change is propagating, you might encounter intermittent `HTTP 404 NoSuchKey` errors for requests to objects created or updated after enabling versioning. We recommend that you wait for 15 minutes after enabling versioning before issuing write operations (`PUT` or `DELETE`) on objects in the bucket.

            Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

            You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

            **Enabled**—Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

            **Suspended**—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

            If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value.

            In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the `x-amz-mfa request` header and the `Status` and the `MfaDelete` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.

            If you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see [Lifecycle and Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config).

        command: "Uploads a part in a multipart upload.\n\nIn this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) operation.\n\nYou must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.\n\nPart numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.\n\nFor information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see [Multipart upload limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nAfter you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.\n\nFor more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .\n\n**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs.\n  \n  These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) and [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nData integrity\n\n**General purpose bucket** - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For more information see [Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html).\n\n**Directory buckets** - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.\n\nEncryption\n\n- **General purpose bucket** - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C).\n  \n  Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html).\n  \n  If you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) blocked for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access Denied error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new data to your bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html).\n  \n  If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following request headers.\n  \n  - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\n  - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key\n  - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5\n  \n  For more information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n- **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).\n\nSpecial errors\n\n- Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`\n  \n  - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found\n  - SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `UploadPart`:\n\n- [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n- [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n- [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        command: "Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.\n\nYou first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) operation or the [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this `CompleteMultipartUpload` operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the `PartNumber` value and the `ETag` value that are returned after that part was uploaded.\n\nThe processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a `200 OK` response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial `200 OK` response has been sent. This means that a `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error. The error response might be embedded in the `200 OK` response. If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).\n\nNote that if `CompleteMultipartUpload` fails, applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see [Amazon S3 Error Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html).\n\nYou can't use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for the CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a `Content-Type` header, `CompleteMultipartUpload` can still return a `200 OK` response.\n\nFor more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  If you provide an [additional checksum value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Checksum.html) in your `MultipartUpload` requests and the object is encrypted with Key Management Service, you must have permission to use the `kms:Decrypt` action for the `CompleteMultipartUpload` request to succeed.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nSpecial errors\n\n- Error Code: `EntityTooSmall`\n  \n  - Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request\n- Error Code: `InvalidPart`\n  \n  - Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified ETag might not have matched the uploaded part's ETag.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request\n- Error Code: `InvalidPartOrder`\n  \n  - Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be specified in order by part number.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request\n- Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`\n  \n  - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.\n  - HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nThe following operations are related to `CompleteMultipartUpload`:\n\n- [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n- [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n- [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n- [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\n- [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

                Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

                **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

                **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            command: "The `HEAD` operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.\n\nA `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` operation on an object. The response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as `400 Bad Request`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `405 Method Not Allowed`, `412 Precondition Failed`, or `304 Not Modified`. It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.\n\nRequest headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html).\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - To use `HEAD`, you must have the `s3:GetObject` permission. You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.\n  \n  - If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found` error.\n  - If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` error.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If you enable `x-amz-checksum-mode` in the request and the object is encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a `HEAD` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.\n\nIf you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:\n\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\nFor more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory bucket** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nVersioning\n\n- If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.\n- If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error and the `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- **Directory buckets** - Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.\n- **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nFor directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nThe following actions are related to `HeadObject`:\n\n- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n- [GetObjectAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html)\n\nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`).

                    **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                    **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form `AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias.

This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.\n\nA `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` operation on an object. The response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as `400 Bad Request`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `405 Method Not Allowed`, `412 Precondition Failed`, or `304 Not Modified`. It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.\n\nRequest headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html).\n\nPermissions\n\n- **General purpose bucket permissions** - To use `HEAD`, you must have the `s3:GetObject` permission. You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n  \n  If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.\n  \n  - If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found` error.\n  - If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` error.\n- **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) .\n  \n  If you enable `x-amz-checksum-mode` in the request and the object is encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a `HEAD` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.\n\nIf you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:\n\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\nFor more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\n**Directory bucket** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.\n\nVersioning\n\n- If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.\n- If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error and the `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- **Directory buckets** - Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.\n- **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n**Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.\n\nFor directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.

                    - `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
                    - `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;

                    Then Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and the data requested.

                if-modified-since: |-
                    Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

                    If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:

                    - `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;
                    - `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;

                    Then Amazon S3 returns the `304 Not Modified` response code.

                key: The object key.
                part-number: Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of parts in this object.
                range: HeadObject returns only the metadata for an object. If the Range is satisfiable, only the `ContentLength` is affected in the response. If the Range is not satisfiable, S3 returns a `416 - Requested Range Not Satisfiable` error.
                request-payer: ""
                response-cache-control: Sets the `Cache-Control` header of the response.
                response-content-disposition: Sets the `Content-Disposition` header of the response.
                response-content-encoding: Sets the `Content-Encoding` header of the response.
                response-content-language: Sets the `Content-Language` header of the response.
                response-content-type: Sets the `Content-Type` header of the response.
                response-expires: Sets the `Expires` header of the response.
                sse-customer-algorithm: |-
                    Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

                    This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
                sse-customer-key: |-
                    Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.

                    This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
                sse-customer-key-m-d5: |-
                    Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

                    This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
                version-id: |-
                    Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

                    For directory buckets in this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported.
