            Deletes a member. Deleting a member removes the member and all associated resources from the network. `DeleteMember` can only be called for a specified `MemberId` if the principal performing the action is associated with the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member. In all other cases, the `DeleteMember` action is carried out as the result of an approved proposal to remove a member. If `MemberId` is the last member in a network specified by the last Amazon Web Services account, the network is deleted also.
