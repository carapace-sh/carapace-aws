You can create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups only at the resource level by specifying a scope name of `ResourceArn` and a scope value of the Auto Scaling group Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This will configure the preference for all instances that are part of the specified Auto Scaling group. You also cannot create recommendation preferences at the resource level for instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group. You can create recommendation preferences at the resource level only for standalone instances.

                The preference to control the resource’s CPU utilization threshold, CPU utilization headroom, and memory utilization headroom. When this preference isn't specified, we use the following default values.

                CPU utilization:

                - `P99_5` for threshold
                - `PERCENT_20` for headroom

            Exports optimization recommendations for Lambda functions.

            Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see [Exporting Recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/exporting-recommendations.html) in the *Compute Optimizer User Guide*.

            You can have only one Lambda function export job in progress per Amazon Web Services Region.
        flag:

                The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts for which to export Lambda function recommendations.

                If your account is the management account of an organization, use this parameter to specify the member account for which you want to export recommendations.

                This parameter cannot be specified together with the include member accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

                Recommendations for member accounts are not included in the export if this parameter, or the include member accounts parameter, is omitted.

                You can specify multiple account IDs per request.
