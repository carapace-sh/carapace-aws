            max-results: Use this parameter when paginating results to specify the maximum number of items to return in the response on each page. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the `NextToken` element is sent in the response. Use this `NextToken` value in a subsequent request to retrieve additional items.
            next-token: Use this parameter when paginating results in a subsequent request after you receive a response with truncated results. Set it to the value of the `NextToken` parameter from the response you just received.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
