            locale: The locale to use for localizing the findings.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return in the response.
            next-token: A token used for pagination of results returned.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            policy-document: The JSON policy document to use as the content for the policy.
            policy-type: |-
                The type of policy to validate. Identity policies grant permissions to IAM principals. Identity policies include managed and inline policies for IAM roles, users, and groups.

                Resource policies grant permissions on Amazon Web Services resources. Resource policies include trust policies for IAM roles and bucket policies for Amazon S3 buckets. You can provide a generic input such as identity policy or resource policy or a specific input such as managed policy or Amazon S3 bucket policy.

                Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy attached to an Amazon Web Services organization, organizational unit (OU), or an account.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            validate-policy-resource-type: |-
                The type of resource to attach to your resource policy. Specify a value for the policy validation resource type only if the policy type is `RESOURCE_POLICY`. For example, to validate a resource policy to attach to an Amazon S3 bucket, you can choose `AWS::S3::Bucket` for the policy validation resource type.

                For resource types not supported as valid values, IAM Access Analyzer runs policy checks that apply to all resource policies. For example, to validate a resource policy to attach to a KMS key, do not specify a value for the policy validation resource type and IAM Access Analyzer will run policy checks that apply to all resource policies.
