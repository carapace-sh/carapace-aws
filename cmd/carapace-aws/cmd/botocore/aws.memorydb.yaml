        command: |-
            Use this operation to add tags to a resource. A tag is a key-value pair where the key and value are case-sensitive. You can use tags to categorize and track all your MemoryDB resources. For more information, see [Tagging your MemoryDB resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/Tagging-Resources.html).

            When you add tags to multi region clusters, you might not immediately see the latest effective tags in the ListTags API response due to it being eventually consistent specifically for multi region clusters. For more information, see [Tagging your MemoryDB resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/Tagging-Resources.html).

            You can specify cost-allocation tags for your MemoryDB resources, Amazon generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services. For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/tagging.html).

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

For more information, see [Tagging your MemoryDB resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/Tagging-Resources.html).

            When you remove tags from multi region clusters, you might not immediately see the latest effective tags in the ListTags API response due to it being eventually consistent specifically for multi region clusters.

            You can specify cost-allocation tags for your MemoryDB resources, Amazon generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.
