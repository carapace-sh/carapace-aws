            format-params: |-
                Options that define the structure of the source file(s) including the format type (`formatType`), header row (`withHeader`), data separation character (`separator`) and the type of compression (`compression`).

                `formatType` is a required attribute and can have the following values:

                - `PARQUET` – Parquet source file format.
                - `CSV` – CSV source file format.
                - `JSON` – JSON source file format.
                - `XML` – XML source file format.

                Here is an example of how you could specify the `formatParams`:

                `"formatParams": { "formatType": "CSV", "withHeader": "true", "separator": ",", "compression":"None" }`

                Note that if you only provide `formatType` as `CSV`, the rest of the attributes will automatically default to CSV values as following:

                `{ "withHeader": "true", "separator": "," }`

                For more information about supported file formats, see [Supported Data Types and File Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/finspace/latest/userguide/supported-data-types.html) in the FinSpace User Guide.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            source-params: |-
                Options that define the location of the data being ingested (`s3SourcePath`) and the source of the changeset (`sourceType`).

                Both `s3SourcePath` and `sourceType` are required attributes.

                Here is an example of how you could specify the `sourceParams`:

                `"sourceParams": { "s3SourcePath": "s3://finspace-landing-us-east-2-bk7gcfvitndqa6ebnvys4d/scratch/wr5hh8pwkpqqkxa4sxrmcw/ingestion/equity.csv", "sourceType": "S3" }`

                The S3 path that you specify must allow the FinSpace role access. To do that, you first need to configure the IAM policy on S3 bucket. For more information, see [Loading data from an Amazon S3 Bucket using the FinSpace API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/finspace/latest/data-api/fs-using-the-finspace-api.html#access-s3-buckets) section.

                `formatType` is a required attribute and can have the following values:

                - `PARQUET` – Parquet source file format.
                - `CSV` – CSV source file format.
                - `JSON` – JSON source file format.
                - `XML` – XML source file format.

                Here is an example of how you could specify the `formatParams`:

                `"formatParams": { "formatType": "CSV", "withHeader": "true", "separator": ",", "compression":"None" }`

                Note that if you only provide `formatType` as `CSV`, the rest of the attributes will automatically default to CSV values as following:

                `{ "withHeader": "true", "separator": "," }`

                For more information about supported file formats, see [Supported Data Types and File Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/finspace/latest/userguide/supported-data-types.html) in the FinSpace User Guide.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            source-params: |-
                Options that define the location of the data being ingested (`s3SourcePath`) and the source of the changeset (`sourceType`).

                Both `s3SourcePath` and `sourceType` are required attributes.

                Here is an example of how you could specify the `sourceParams`:

                `"sourceParams": { "s3SourcePath": "s3://finspace-landing-us-east-2-bk7gcfvitndqa6ebnvys4d/scratch/wr5hh8pwkpqqkxa4sxrmcw/ingestion/equity.csv", "sourceType": "S3" }`

                The S3 path that you specify must allow the FinSpace role access. To do that, you first need to configure the IAM policy on S3 bucket. For more information, see [Loading data from an Amazon S3 Bucket using the FinSpace API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/finspace/latest/data-api/fs-using-the-finspace-api.html#access-s3-buckets)section.
