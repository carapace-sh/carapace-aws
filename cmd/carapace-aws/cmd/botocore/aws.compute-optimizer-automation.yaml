            Associates one or more member accounts with your organization's management account, enabling centralized implementation of optimization actions across those accounts. Once associated, the management account (or a delegated administrator) can apply recommended actions to the member account.

If the member account has not previously enabled the Automation feature, the association process automatically enables it.

                - Active - Enables the Automation feature for your account.
                - Inactive - Disables the Automation feature for your account and stops all of your automation rules. If you opt in again later, all rules will be inactive, and you must enable the rules you want to run. You must wait at least 24 hours after opting out to opt in again.

                The `Pending` and `Failed` options cannot be used to update the enrollment status of an account. They are returned in the response of a request to update the enrollment status of an account.

                If you are a member account, your account must be disassociated from your organization’s management account before you can disable Automation. Contact your administrator to make this change.
