            It is not possible to associate a Customer Profiles domain with an Amazon Connect Instance directly from the API. If you would like to create a domain and associate a Customer Profiles domain, use the Amazon Connect admin website.

            GetMatches returns potentially matching profiles, based on the results of the latest run of a machine learning process.

            The process of matching duplicate profiles. If `Matching` = `true`, Amazon Connect Customer Profiles starts a weekly batch process called Identity Resolution Job. If you do not specify a date and time for Identity Resolution Job to run, by default it runs every Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains.

            After the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the [GetMatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_GetMatches.html) API to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured `ExportingConfig` in the `MatchingRequest`, you can download the results from S3.

            Amazon Connect uses the following profile attributes to identify matches:

            - PhoneNumber
            - HomePhoneNumber
            - BusinessPhoneNumber
            - MobilePhoneNumber
            - EmailAddress
            - PersonalEmailAddress
            - BusinessEmailAddress
            - FullName

            For example, two or more profiles—with spelling mistakes such as **John Doe** and **Jhn Doe**, or different casing email addresses such as **JOHN\_DOE@ANYCOMPANY.COM** and **johndoe@anycompany.com**, or different phone number formats such as **555-010-0000** and **+1-555-010-0000**—can be detected as belonging to the same customer **John Doe** and merged into a unified profile.

            Tests the auto-merging settings of your Identity Resolution Job without merging your data. It randomly selects a sample of matching groups from the existing matching results, and applies the automerging settings that you provided. You can then view the number of profiles in the sample, the number of matches, and the number of profiles identified to be merged. This enables you to evaluate the accuracy of the attributes in your matching list.

            You can't view which profiles are matched and would be merged.

            We strongly recommend you use this API to do a dry run of the automerging process before running the Identity Resolution Job. Include **at least** two matching attributes. If your matching list includes too few attributes (such as only `FirstName` or only `LastName`), there may be a large number of matches. This increases the chances of erroneous merges.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
