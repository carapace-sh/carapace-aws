            After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker AI hosting services, your client applications use this API to get inferences from the model hosted at the specified endpoint in an asynchronous manner.

            Inference requests sent to this API are enqueued for asynchronous processing. The processing of the inference request may or may not complete before you receive a response from this API. The response from this API will not contain the result of the inference request but contain information about where you can locate it.

            Amazon SageMaker AI strips all POST headers except those supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker AI might add additional headers. You should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syntax.

            Calls to `InvokeEndpointAsync` are authenticated by using Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For information, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

                Provides additional information about a request for an inference submitted to a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint. The information is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim. You could use this value, for example, to provide an ID that you can use to track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint was programmed to process. The value must consist of no more than 1024 visible US-ASCII characters as specified in [Section 3.3.6. Field Value Components](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6) of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1).

                The code in your model is responsible for setting or updating any custom attributes in the response. If your code does not set this value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the custom attribute with `Trace ID:` in your post-processing function.

                This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services SDKs but not in the Amazon SageMaker AI Python SDK.

            Invokes a model at the specified endpoint to return the inference response as a stream. The inference stream provides the response payload incrementally as a series of parts. Before you can get an inference stream, you must have access to a model that's deployed using Amazon SageMaker AI hosting services, and the container for that model must support inference streaming.

            For more information that can help you use this API, see the following sections in the *Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide*:

            - For information about how to add streaming support to a model, see [How Containers Serve Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-code-how-containe-serves-requests).
            - For information about how to process the streaming response, see [Invoke real-time endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-test-endpoints.html).

            Before you can use this operation, your IAM permissions must allow the `sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint` action. For more information about Amazon SageMaker AI actions for IAM policies, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonsagemaker.html) in the *IAM Service Authorization Reference*.

In your request, you specify `NEW_SESSION` for the `SessionId` request parameter. The response to that request provides the session ID for the `NewSessionId` response parameter.
