                next-token: Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a `nextToken` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's `nextToken` response to request the next page of results.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                plan-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Region switch plan to retrieve evaluation status for.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

        Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Region switch helps you to quickly and reliably shift traffic away from an impaired Amazon Web Services Region to a healthy Region. With Region switch, you can create plans that define the steps to shift traffic for your application from one Amazon Web Services Region to another. You can test your plans in practice mode before using them in a real recovery scenario.

        Region switch provides a structured approach to multi-Region failover, helping you to meet your recovery time objectives (RTOs) and maintain business continuity during regional disruptions.

        For more information, see [Region switch in ARC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/region-switch.html) in the *Amazon Application Recovery Controller User Guide*.
