            Imports security findings generated by a finding provider into Security Hub. This action is requested by the finding provider to import its findings into Security Hub.

            `BatchImportFindings` must be called by one of the following:

            - The Amazon Web Services account that is associated with a finding if you are using the [default product ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-custom-providers.html#securityhub-custom-providers-bfi-reqs) or are a partner sending findings from within a customer's Amazon Web Services account. In these cases, the identifier of the account that you are calling `BatchImportFindings` from needs to be the same as the `AwsAccountId` attribute for the finding.
            - An Amazon Web Services account that Security Hub has allow-listed for an official partner integration. In this case, you can call `BatchImportFindings` from the allow-listed account and send findings from different customer accounts in the same batch.

            The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb.

            After a finding is created, `BatchImportFindings` cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow.

            - `Note`
            - `UserDefinedFields`
            - `VerificationState`
            - `Workflow`

            Finding providers also should not use `BatchImportFindings` to update the following attributes.

            - `Confidence`
            - `Criticality`
            - `RelatedFindings`
            - `Severity`
            - `Types`

            Instead, finding providers use `FindingProviderFields` to provide values for these attributes.

Administrator and member accounts can use this operation to update the following fields and objects for one or more findings:

            - `Confidence`

            If you use this operation to update a finding, your updates don’t affect the value for the `UpdatedAt` field of the finding. Also note that it can take several minutes for Security Hub to process your request and update each finding specified in the request.

            You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to suppress findings or change the finding severity.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

            max-results: The maximum number of items to return in the response.

                If `OnlyAssociated` is set to `FALSE`, the response includes all existing member accounts.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Enables Security Hub for your account in the current Region or the Region you specify in the request.

            When you enable Security Hub, you grant to Security Hub the permissions necessary to gather findings from other services that are integrated with Security Hub.

            When you use the `EnableSecurityHub` operation to enable Security Hub, you also automatically enable the following standards:

            - Center for Internet Security (CIS) Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0
            - Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices

            Other standards are not automatically enabled.

            To opt out of automatically enabled standards, set `EnableDefaultStandards` to `false`.

            After you enable Security Hub, to enable a standard, use the `BatchEnableStandards` operation. To disable a standard, use the `BatchDisableStandards` operation.

            To learn more, see the [setup information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide*.

            Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account.

            `CreateMembers` is always used to add accounts that are not organization members.

            For accounts that are managed using Organizations, `CreateMembers` is only used in the following cases:

            - Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization accounts.
            - The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.

            This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the `EnableSecurityHub` operation.

            For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the `InviteMembers` operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub.

            Accounts that are managed using Organizations don't receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.

            - If the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account.
            - For organization accounts that already have Security Hub enabled, Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not change their enabled standards or controls.

            A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account.

            To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the `DisassociateFromMasterAccount` or `DisassociateMembers` operation.
        flag:
            account-details: The list of accounts to associate with the Security Hub administrator account. For each account, the list includes the account ID and optionally the email address.

For information, see [Managing Security Hub administrator and member accounts with Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-accounts-orgs.html) in the *Security Hub User Guide*.

            Invites other Amazon Web Services accounts to become member accounts for the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation is sent from.

            This operation is only used to invite accounts that don't belong to an Amazon Web Services organization. Organization accounts don't receive invitations.

            Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must first use the `CreateMembers` action to create the member account in Security Hub.

            When the account owner enables Security Hub and accepts the invitation to become a member account, the administrator account can view the findings generated in the member account.

                By default, this is set to `true`, and new controls are enabled automatically. To not automatically enable new controls, set this to `false`.

                When you automatically enable new controls, you can interact with the controls in the console and programmatically immediately after release. However, automatically enabled controls have a temporary default status of `DISABLED`. It can take up to several days for Security Hub to process the control release and designate the control as `ENABLED` in your account. During the processing period, you can manually enable or disable a control, and Security Hub will maintain that designation regardless of whether you have `AutoEnableControls` set to `true`.
