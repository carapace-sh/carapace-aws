            When an image is pushed and all new image layers have been uploaded, the PutImage API is called once to create or update the image manifest and the tags that are associated with the image.

            This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the `docker` CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

            Returns metadata that's related to the images in a repository in a public registry.

            Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output of the `docker images` command shows the uncompressed image size. Therefore, it might return a larger image size than the image sizes that are returned by [DescribeImages]().

        Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public

        Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public (Amazon ECR Public) is a managed container image registry service. Amazon ECR provides both public and private registries to host your container images. You can use the Docker CLI or your preferred client to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see [Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
