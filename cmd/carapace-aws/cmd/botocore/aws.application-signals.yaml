            Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource, such as a service level objective.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the `TagResource` action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.

      documentation:
        command: "Creates a service level objective (SLO), which can help you ensure that your critical business operations are meeting customer expectations. Use SLOs to set and track specific target levels for the reliability and availability of your applications and services. SLOs use service level indicators (SLIs) to calculate whether the application is performing at the level that you want.\n\nCreate an SLO to set a target for a service or operation’s availability or latency. CloudWatch measures this target frequently you can find whether it has been breached.\n\nThe target performance quality that is defined for an SLO is the *attainment goal*.\n\nYou can set SLO targets for your applications that are discovered by Application Signals, using critical metrics such as latency and availability. You can also set SLOs against any CloudWatch metric or math expression that produces a time series.\n\nYou can't create an SLO for a service operation that was discovered by Application Signals until after that operation has reported standard metrics to Application Signals.\n\nWhen you create an SLO, you specify whether it is a *period-based SLO* or a *request-based SLO*. Each type of SLO has a different way of evaluating your application's performance against its attainment goal.\n\n- A *period-based SLO* uses defined *periods* of time within a specified total time interval. For each period of time, Application Signals determines whether the application met its goal. The attainment rate is calculated as the `number of good periods/number of total periods`.\n  \n  For example, for a period-based SLO, meeting an attainment goal of 99.9% means that within your interval, your application must meet its performance goal during at least 99.9% of the time periods.\n- A *request-based SLO* doesn't use pre-defined periods of time. Instead, the SLO measures `number of good requests/number of total requests` during the interval. At any time, you can find the ratio of good requests to total requests for the interval up to the time stamp that you specify, and measure that ratio against the goal set in your SLO.\n\nAfter you have created an SLO, you can retrieve error budget reports for it. An *error budget* is the amount of time or amount of requests that your application can be non-compliant with the SLO's goal, and still have your application meet the goal.\n\n- For a period-based SLO, the error budget starts at a number defined by the highest number of periods that can fail to meet the threshold, while still meeting the overall goal. The *remaining error budget* decreases with every failed period that is recorded. The error budget within one interval can never increase.\n  \n  For example, an SLO with a threshold that 99.95% of requests must be completed under 2000ms every month translates to an error budget of 21.9 minutes of downtime per month.\n- For a request-based SLO, the remaining error budget is dynamic and can increase or decrease, depending on the ratio of good requests to total requests.\n\nFor more information about SLOs, see [Service level objectives (SLOs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-ServiceLevelObjectives.html).\n\nWhen you perform a `CreateServiceLevelObjective` operation, Application Signals creates the *AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals* service-linked role, if it doesn't already exist in your account. This service- linked role has the following permissions:\n\n- `xray:GetServiceGraph`\n- `logs:StartQuery`\n- `logs:GetQueryResults`\n- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`\n- `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`\n- `tag:GetResources`\n- `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups`"
        flag:
            burn-rate-configurations: Use this array to create *burn rates* for this SLO. Each burn rate is a metric that indicates how fast the service is consuming the error budget, relative to the attainment goal of the SLO.

            Enables this Amazon Web Services account to be able to use CloudWatch Application Signals by creating the *AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals* service-linked role. This service- linked role has the following permissions:

            - `xray:GetServiceGraph`
            - `logs:StartQuery`
            - `logs:GetQueryResults`
            - `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`
            - `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
            - `tag:GetResources`
            - `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups`

            A service-linked CloudTrail event channel is created to process CloudTrail events and return change event information. This includes last deployment time, userName, eventName, and other event metadata.

            After completing this step, you still need to instrument your Java and Python applications to send data to Application Signals. For more information, see [Enabling Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable.html).

            Use this operation to retrieve one or more *service level objective (SLO) budget reports*.

            An *error budget* is the amount of time or requests in an unhealthy state that your service can accumulate during an interval before your overall SLO budget health is breached and the SLO is considered to be unmet. For example, an SLO with a threshold of 99.95% and a monthly interval translates to an error budget of 21.9 minutes of downtime in a 30-day month.

            Budget reports include a health indicator, the attainment value, and remaining budget.

            For more information about SLO error budgets, see [SLO concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-ServiceLevelObjectives.html#CloudWatch-ServiceLevelObjectives-concepts).

        Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of your cloud-based applications. It enables real-time service health dashboards and helps you track long-term performance trends against your business goals. The application-centric view provides you with unified visibility across your applications, services, and dependencies, so you can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any issues that may arise, ensuring optimal customer experience.

        Application Signals provides the following benefits:

        - Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency, faults, and errors.
        - Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).
        - See a map of your application topology that Application Signals automatically discovers, that gives you a visual representation of your applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.

        Application Signals works with CloudWatch RUM, CloudWatch Synthetics canaries, and Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry, to display your client pages, Synthetics canaries, and application names within dashboards and maps.
