            Creates an Amazon Web Services account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because `CreateAccount` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

            - Use the `Id` value of the `CreateAccountStatus` response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the [DescribeCreateAccountStatus]() operation.
            - Check the CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see [Logging and monitoring in Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

            The user who calls the API to create an account must have the `organizations:CreateAccount` permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, Organizations creates the required service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more information, see [Organizations and service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

            If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the `organizations:TagResource` permission.

            Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account.

            You can only call this operation from the management account.

            For more information about creating accounts, see [Creating a member account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

            - When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method is *not* automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. For more information, see [Considerations before removing an account from an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.
            - If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact [Amazon Web Services Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
            - If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact [Amazon Web Services Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
            - It isn't recommended to use `CreateAccount` to create multiple temporary accounts, and using the `CreateAccount` API to close accounts is subject to a 30-day usage quota. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see [Closing a member account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

            When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see [Granting access to your billing information and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html#grantaccess).

            Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that Organizations supports. For more information, see [Enabling all features in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

            This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.

            After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using [EnablePolicyType]() and [DisablePolicyType](). To see the status of policy types in a root, use [ListRoots]().

            After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains `"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"`. This completes the change.

            After you enable all features in your organization, the management account in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account administrators are aware of this.

            You can only call this operation from the management account.

            Disables an organizational policy type in a root. A policy of a certain type can be attached to entities in a root only if that type is enabled in the root. After you perform this operation, you no longer can attach policies of the specified type to that root or to any organizational unit (OU) or account in that root. You can undo this by using the [EnablePolicyType]() operation.

            This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. If you disable a policy type for a root, it still appears enabled for the organization if [all features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html) are enabled for the organization. Amazon Web Services recommends that you first use [ListRoots]() to see the status of policy types for a specified root, and then use this operation.

            You can only call this operation from the management account or a member account that is a delegated administrator.

            To view the status of available policy types in the organization, use [ListRoots]().

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Disables the integration of an Amazon Web Services service (the service that is specified by `ServicePrincipal`) with Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a [service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in *new* accounts in your organization. This means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.

            We ***strongly recommend*** that you don't use this command to disable integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling trusted access.

            For information about how to disable trusted service access to your organization using the trusted service, see the **Learn more** link under the **Supports Trusted Access** column at [Amazon Web Services services that you can use with Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html). on this page.

            If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following actions to occur:

            - The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the accounts in your organization. This means that the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.
            - The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.
            - Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the integration.

            Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service.

            After you perform the `DisableAWSServiceAccess` operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization's accounts

            For more information about integrating other services with Organizations, including the list of services that work with Organizations, see [Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

                - **Root** - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
                - **Organizational unit (OU)** - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

That means that if the tag policy changes between the invitation and the acceptance, then that tags could potentially be non-compliant.

To remove a member account as a user in the management account, use [RemoveAccountFromOrganization]() instead.\n\nYou can only call from operation from a member account.\n\n- The management account in an organization with all features enabled can set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what administrators of member accounts can do. This includes preventing them from successfully calling `LeaveOrganization` and leaving the organization.\n- You can leave an organization as a member account only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you must perform the following steps. If any of the steps are already completed for this account, that step doesn't appear.\n  \n  - Choose a support plan\n  - Provide and verify the required contact information\n  - Provide a current payment method\n  \n  Amazon Web Services uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) Amazon Web Services activity that occurs while the account isn't attached to an organization. For more information, see [Considerations before removing an account from an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.\n- The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated administrator account for any Amazon Web Services service enabled for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first change the delegated administrator account to another account that is remaining in the organization.\n- After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. Amazon Web Services accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.\n- A newly created account has a waiting period before it can be removed from its organization. You must wait until at least four days after the account was created. Invited accounts aren't subject to this waiting period.\n- If you are using an organization principal to call `LeaveOrganization` across multiple accounts, you can only do this up to 5 accounts per second in a single organization."

            Creates an organizational unit (OU) within a root or parent OU. An OU is a container for accounts that enables you to organize your accounts to apply policies according to your business requirements. The number of levels deep that you can nest OUs is dependent upon the policy types enabled for that root. For service control policies, the limit is five.

To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the [TagResource]() operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists.\n\nYou call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html) in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.\n\nCalling `CreateGovCloudAccount` is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because `CreateGovCloudAccount` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:\n\n- Use the `OperationId` response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the [DescribeCreateAccountStatus]() operation.\n- Check the CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see [Logging and monitoring in Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.\n\nWhen you call the `CreateGovCloudAccount` action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.\n\nA role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html) in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.\n\nFor more information about creating accounts, see [Creating a member account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.\n\n- When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is *not* automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. For more information, see [Considerations before removing an account from an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.\n- If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact [Amazon Web Services Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).\n- If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact [Amazon Web Services Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).\n- Using `CreateGovCloudAccount` to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see [Closing a member account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.\n\nWhen you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information.

Establishing these permissions can be a first step in enabling the integration of an Amazon Web Services service with Organizations.

            We recommend that you enable integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the service is aware that it can create the resources that are required for the integration. How the service creates those resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service.

            For more information about enabling services to integrate with Organizations, see [Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) in the *Organizations User Guide*.

            Lists the roots that are defined in the current organization.

            When calling List* operations, always check the `NextToken` response parameter value, even if you receive an empty result set. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when more results are available. Continue making requests until `NextToken` returns null. A null `NextToken` value indicates that you have retrieved all available results.

            You can only call this operation from the management account or a member account that is a delegated administrator.

            Policy types can be enabled and disabled in roots. This is distinct from whether they're available in the organization. When you enable all features, you make policy types available for use in that organization. Individual policy types can then be enabled and disabled in a root. To see the availability of a policy type in an organization, use [DescribeOrganization]().

            name: |-
                The new name that you want to assign to the OU.

                The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
            organizational-unit-id: |-
                ID for the OU that you want to rename. You can get the ID from the [ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent]() operation.

                The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for an organizational unit ID string requires "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

    command: "Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an *organization* and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.\n\nThis guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the [Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).\n\n**Support and feedback for Organizations**\n\nWe welcome your feedback. You can post your feedback and questions in the [Organizations support forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219). For more information about the Amazon Web Services Support forums, see [Forums Help](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa).\n\n**Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK**\n\nFor the current release of Organizations, specify the `us-east-1` region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify `cn-northwest-1`. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:\n\n- Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:\n  \n  `--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` *(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)*\n  \n  or\n  \n  `--endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn` *(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)*\n- Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:\n  \n  `aws configure set default.region us-east-1` *(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)*\n  \n  or\n  \n  `aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1` *(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)*\n- Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:\n  \n  `--region us-east-1` *(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)*\n  \n  or\n  \n  `--region cn-northwest-1` *(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)*\n\n**Recording API Requests**\n\nOrganizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see [Logging Organizations API calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration) in the *Organizations User Guide*. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html)."
