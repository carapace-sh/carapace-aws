For each subnet endpoint that you add, Global Accelerator creates a new static port mapping for the accelerator. The port mappings don't change after Global Accelerator generates them, so you can retrieve and cache the full mapping on your servers.

            If you remove a subnet from your accelerator, Global Accelerator removes (reclaims) the port mappings. If you add a subnet to your accelerator, Global Accelerator creates new port mappings (the existing ones don't change). If you add or remove EC2 instances in your subnet, the port mappings don't change, because the mappings are created when you add the subnet to Global Accelerator.

            The mappings also include a flag for each destination denoting which destination IP addresses and ports are allowed or denied traffic.

                After you bring an address range to Amazon Web Services, it appears in your account as an address pool. When you create an accelerator, you can assign one IPv4 address from your range to it. Global Accelerator assigns you a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP address range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges to Amazon Web Services, you can assign one IPv4 address from each range to your accelerator. This restriction is because Global Accelerator assigns each address range to a different network zone, for high availability.

                You can specify one or two addresses, separated by a space. Do not include the /32 suffix.

                Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator. To change them, you must create a new accelerator with the new addresses.

                Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

                Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is `NONE`, Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.

                If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to `SOURCE_IP` instead. When you use the `SOURCE_IP` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

                The default value is `NONE`.

                Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.

                Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is `NONE`, Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.

                If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to `SOURCE_IP` instead. When you use the `SOURCE_IP` setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

                The default value is `NONE`.

The number of ports required is: subnet size times the number of ports per destination EC2 instances. For example, a subnet defined as /24 requires a listener port range of at least 255 ports.

            Note: You must have enough remaining listener ports available to map to the subnet ports, or the call will fail with a LimitExceededException.

            By default, all destinations in a subnet in a custom routing accelerator cannot receive traffic. To enable all destinations to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic, see the [AllowCustomRoutingTraffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_AllowCustomRoutingTraffic.html) operation.

            Add endpoints to an endpoint group. The `AddEndpoints` API operation is the recommended option for adding endpoints. The alternative options are to add endpoints when you create an endpoint group (with the [CreateEndpointGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_CreateEndpointGroup.html) API) or when you update an endpoint group (with the [UpdateEndpointGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_UpdateEndpointGroup.html) API).

            There are two advantages to using `AddEndpoints` to add endpoints in Global Accelerator:

            - It's faster, because Global Accelerator only has to resolve the new endpoints that you're adding, rather than resolving new and existing endpoints.
            - It's more convenient, because you don't need to specify the current endpoints that are already in the endpoint group, in addition to the new endpoints that you want to add.

            For information about endpoint types and requirements for endpoints that you can add to Global Accelerator, see [Endpoints for standard accelerators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints.html) in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

            Delete a custom routing accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set `Enabled` to false.

            When you create a custom routing accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses.

            The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see [Identity and access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/auth-and-access-control.html) in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

            Create a cross-account attachment in Global Accelerator. You create a cross-account attachment to specify the *principals* who have permission to work with *resources* in accelerators in their own account. You specify, in the same attachment, the resources that are shared.

            A principal can be an Amazon Web Services account number or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an accelerator. For account numbers that are listed as principals, to work with a resource listed in the attachment, you must sign in to an account specified as a principal. Then, you can work with resources that are listed, with any of your accelerators. If an accelerator ARN is listed in the cross-account attachment as a principal, anyone with permission to make updates to the accelerator can work with resources that are listed in the attachment.

            Specify each principal and resource separately. To specify two CIDR address pools, list them individually under `Resources`, and so on. For a command line operation, for example, you might use a statement like the following:

            `"Resources": [{"Cidr": "169.254.60.0/24"},{"Cidr": "169.254.59.0/24"}]`

            Create a custom routing accelerator. A custom routing accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of Amazon EC2 instance destinations running in a single or multiple virtual private clouds (VPC) subnet endpoints.

            Be aware that, by default, all destination EC2 instances in a VPC subnet endpoint cannot receive traffic. To enable all destinations to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic, see the [AllowCustomRoutingTraffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_AllowCustomRoutingTraffic.html) operation.

            Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify `--region us-west-2` on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.

                After you bring an address range to Amazon Web Services, it appears in your account as an address pool. When you create an accelerator, you can assign one IPv4 address from your range to it. Global Accelerator assigns you a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP address range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges to Amazon Web Services, you can assign one IPv4 address from each range to your accelerator. This restriction is because Global Accelerator assigns each address range to a different network zone, for high availability.

                You can specify one or two addresses, separated by a space. Do not include the /32 suffix.

                Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator. To change them, you must create a new accelerator with the new addresses.

            Delete an accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set `Enabled` to false.

            When you create an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses. Alternatively, you can bring your own IP address ranges to Global Accelerator and assign IP addresses from those ranges.

            The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.
