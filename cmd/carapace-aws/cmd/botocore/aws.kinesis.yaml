            Increases the Kinesis data stream's retention period, which is the length of time data records are accessible after they are added to the stream. The maximum value of a stream's retention period is 8760 hours (365 days).

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            If you choose a longer stream retention period, this operation increases the time period during which records that have not yet expired are accessible. However, it does not make previous, expired data (older than the stream's previous retention period) accessible after the operation has been called. For example, if a stream's retention period is set to 24 hours and is increased to 168 hours, any data that is older than 24 hours remains inaccessible to consumer applications.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. `SplitShard` is called when there is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of data records being ingested. This API is only supported for the data streams with the provisioned capacity mode.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            You can also use `SplitShard` when a shard appears to be approaching its maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call `SplitShard` to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time processing.

            You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the shard. For more information, see [Split a Shard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            You can use [DescribeStreamSummary]() and the [ListShards]() APIs to determine the shard ID and hash key values for the `ShardToSplit` and `NewStartingHashKey` parameters that are specified in the `SplitShard` request.

            `SplitShard` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a `SplitShard` request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the stream status to `UPDATING`. After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to `ACTIVE`. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the `UPDATING` state.

            You can use [DescribeStreamSummary]() to check the status of the stream, which is returned in `StreamStatus`. If the stream is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can call `SplitShard`.

            If the specified stream does not exist, [DescribeStreamSummary]() returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`. If you try to create more shards than are authorized for your account, you receive a `LimitExceededException`.

            For the default shard limit for an Amazon Web Services account, see [Kinesis Data Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*. To increase this limit, [contact Amazon Web Services Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

            If you try to operate on too many streams simultaneously using [CreateStream](), [DeleteStream](), [MergeShards](), and/or [SplitShard](), you receive a `LimitExceededException`.

            `SplitShard` has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of shards to return in a single call to `ListShards`. The maximum number of shards to return in a single call. The default value is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000, at most 1000 results are returned.

                When the number of shards to be listed is greater than the value of `MaxResults`, the response contains a `NextToken` value that you can use in a subsequent call to `ListShards` to list the next set of shards.
            next-token: |-
                When the number of shards in the data stream is greater than the default value for the `MaxResults` parameter, or if you explicitly specify a value for `MaxResults` that is less than the number of shards in the data stream, the response includes a pagination token named `NextToken`. You can specify this `NextToken` value in a subsequent call to `ListShards` to list the next set of shards.

                Don't specify `StreamName` or `StreamCreationTimestamp` if you specify `NextToken` because the latter unambiguously identifies the stream.

                You can optionally specify a value for the `MaxResults` parameter when you specify `NextToken`. If you specify a `MaxResults` value that is less than the number of shards that the operation returns if you don't specify `MaxResults`, the response will contain a new `NextToken` value. You can use the new `NextToken` value in a subsequent call to the `ListShards` operation.

                Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you obtain a value for `NextToken` in the response to a call to `ListShards`, you have 300 seconds to use that value. If you specify an expired token in a call to `ListShards`, you get `ExpiredNextTokenException`.

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            shard-filter: |-
                Enables you to filter out the response of the `ListShards` API. You can only specify one filter at a time.

                If you use the `ShardFilter` parameter when invoking the ListShards API, the `Type` is the required property and must be specified. If you specify the `AT_TRIM_HORIZON`, `FROM_TRIM_HORIZON`, or `AT_LATEST` types, you do not need to specify either the `ShardId` or the `Timestamp` optional properties.

                If you specify the `AFTER_SHARD_ID` type, you must also provide the value for the optional `ShardId` property. The `ShardId` property is identical in fuctionality to the `ExclusiveStartShardId` parameter of the `ListShards` API. When `ShardId` property is specified, the response includes the shards starting with the shard whose ID immediately follows the `ShardId` that you provided.

                If you specify the `AT_TIMESTAMP` or `FROM_TIMESTAMP_ID` type, you must also provide the value for the optional `Timestamp` property. If you specify the AT\_TIMESTAMP type, then all shards that were open at the provided timestamp are returned. If you specify the FROM\_TIMESTAMP type, then all shards starting from the provided timestamp to TIP are returned.

            Writes multiple data records into a Kinesis data stream in a single call (also referred to as a `PutRecords` request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            Each `PutRecords` request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 10 MiB, up to a limit of 10 MiB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second.

            You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request `Records`, with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob.

            The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see [Adding Data to a Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            Each record in the `Records` array may include an optional parameter, `ExplicitHashKey`, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see [Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            The `PutRecords` response includes an array of response `Records`. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response `Records` array always includes the same number of records as the request array.

            The response `Records` array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each `PutRecords` request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use [PutRecord]() instead of `PutRecords`, and write to the same shard.

            A successfully processed record includes `ShardId` and `SequenceNumber` values. The `ShardId` parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The `SequenceNumber` parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.

            An unsuccessfully processed record includes `ErrorCode` and `ErrorMessage` values. `ErrorCode` reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or `InternalFailure`. `ErrorMessage` provides more detailed information about the `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see [Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.

            By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use [IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod]() or [DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod]() to modify this retention period.

            Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to `UPDATING`. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to `ACTIVE`. Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is `UPDATING`. Once the status of the stream is `ACTIVE`, encryption begins for records written to the stream.

            API Limits: You can successfully apply a new Amazon Web Services KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period.

            Gets data records from a Kinesis data stream's shard.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            Specify a shard iterator using the `ShardIterator` parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, [GetRecords]() returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.

            You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more information, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call [GetRecords]() in a loop. Use [GetShardIterator]() to get the shard iterator to specify in the first [GetRecords]() call. [GetRecords]() returns a new shard iterator in `NextShardIterator`. Specify the shard iterator returned in `NextShardIterator` in subsequent calls to [GetRecords](). If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and [GetRecords]() returns `null` in `NextShardIterator`. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.

            Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the `Limit` parameter to specify the maximum number of records that [GetRecords]() can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000.

            The size of the data returned by [GetRecords]() varies depending on the utilization of the shard. It is recommended that consumer applications retrieve records via the `GetRecords` command using the 5 TPS limit to remain caught up. Retrieving records less frequently can lead to consumer applications falling behind. The maximum size of data that [GetRecords]() can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. [GetRecords]() doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to [GetRecords](). However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.

            To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the `MillisBehindLatest` response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see [Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*).

            Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, `ApproximateArrivalTimestamp`, that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with [PutRecords]()). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.

            This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.

            Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards.

            You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the `ShardIteratorType` parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to [PutRecord](), [PutRecords](), [GetRecords](), or [DescribeStream](). In the request, you can specify the shard iterator type `AT_TIMESTAMP` to read records from an arbitrary point in time, `TRIM_HORIZON` to cause `ShardIterator` to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or `LATEST` so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.

            When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a [GetShardIterator]() request to get the first shard iterator for use in your first [GetRecords]() request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the [GetRecords]() request in `NextShardIterator`. A new shard iterator is returned by every [GetRecords]() request in `NextShardIterator`, which you use in the `ShardIterator` parameter of the next [GetRecords]() request.

            If a [GetShardIterator]() request is made too often, you receive a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. For more information about throughput limits, see [GetRecords](), and [Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            If the shard is closed, [GetShardIterator]() returns a valid iterator for the last sequence number of the shard. A shard can be closed as a result of using [SplitShard]() or [MergeShards]().

            [GetShardIterator]() has a limit of five transactions per second per account per open shard.

            Updates the warm throughput configuration for the specified Amazon Kinesis Data Streams on-demand data stream. This operation allows you to proactively scale your on-demand data stream to a specified throughput level, enabling better performance for sudden traffic spikes.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            Updating the warm throughput is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to `UPDATING`. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to `ACTIVE`. Depending on the size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is `UPDATING`.

            This operation is only supported for data streams with the on-demand capacity mode in accounts that have `MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment` enabled. Provisioned capacity mode streams do not support warm throughput configuration.

            This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the following:

            - Scale to more than 10 GiBps for an on-demand stream.
            - This API has a call limit of 5 transactions per second (TPS) for each Amazon Web Services account. TPS over 5 will initiate the `LimitExceededException`.

            For the default limits for an Amazon Web Services account, see [Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            This operation establishes an HTTP/2 connection between the consumer you specify in the `ConsumerARN` parameter and the shard you specify in the `ShardId` parameter. After the connection is successfully established, Kinesis Data Streams pushes records from the shard to the consumer over this connection. Before you call this operation, call [RegisterStreamConsumer]() to register the consumer with Kinesis Data Streams.

            When the `SubscribeToShard` call succeeds, your consumer starts receiving events of type [SubscribeToShardEvent]() over the HTTP/2 connection for up to 5 minutes, after which time you need to call `SubscribeToShard` again to renew the subscription if you want to continue to receive records.

            You can make one call to `SubscribeToShard` per second per registered consumer per shard. For example, if you have a 4000 shard stream and two registered stream consumers, you can make one `SubscribeToShard` request per second for each combination of shard and registered consumer, allowing you to subscribe both consumers to all 4000 shards in one second.

            If you call `SubscribeToShard` again with the same `ConsumerARN` and `ShardId` within 5 seconds of a successful call, you'll get a `ResourceInUseException`. If you call `SubscribeToShard` 5 seconds or more after a successful call, the second call takes over the subscription and the previous connection expires or fails with a `ResourceInUseException`.

            Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer you register can then call [SubscribeToShard]() to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

            You can add tags to the registered consumer when making a `RegisterStreamConsumer` request by setting the `Tags` parameter. If you pass the `Tags` parameter, in addition to having the `kinesis:RegisterStreamConsumer` permission, you must also have the `kinesis:TagResource` permission for the consumer that will be registered. Tags will take effect from the `CREATING` status of the consumer.

            With On-demand Advantage streams, you can register up to 50 consumers per stream to use Enhanced Fan-out. With On-demand Standard and Provisioned streams, you can register up to 20 consumers per stream to use Enhanced Fan-out. A given consumer can only be registered with one stream at a time.

            For an example of how to use this operation, see [Enhanced Fan-Out Using the Kinesis Data Streams API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/building-enhanced-consumers-api.html).

            The use of this operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account. Also, only 5 consumers can be created simultaneously. In other words, you cannot have more than 5 consumers in a `CREATING` status at the same time. Registering a 6th consumer while there are 5 in a `CREATING` status results in a `LimitExceededException`.

            Describes the specified Kinesis data stream.

            This API has been revised. It's highly recommended that you use the [DescribeStreamSummary]() API to get a summarized description of the specified Kinesis data stream and the [ListShards]() API to list the shards in a specified data stream and obtain information about each shard.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard. Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number, which is assigned when the record is put into the stream.

            You can limit the number of shards returned by each call. For more information, see [Retrieving Shards from a Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-retrieve-shards.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            There are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned. To process shards in chronological order, use the ID of the parent shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard.

            This operation has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.

            Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call `PutRecord` to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 10 MiB per second.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself.

            The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.

            The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs.

            Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the `ExplicitHashKey` parameter. For more information, see [Adding Data to a Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            `PutRecord` returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record.

            Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and use the `SequenceNumberForOrdering` parameter. For more information, see [Adding Data to a Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.

            If a `PutRecord` request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, `PutRecord` throws `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.

            By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use [IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod]() or [DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod]() to modify this retention period.

            Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. This API is only supported for the data streams with the provisioned capacity mode. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            `MergeShards` is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about merging shards, see [Merge Two Shards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-merge.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

            If the stream is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can call `MergeShards`. If a stream is in the `CREATING`, `UPDATING`, or `DELETING` state, `MergeShards` returns a `ResourceInUseException`. If the specified stream does not exist, `MergeShards` returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`.

            You can use [DescribeStreamSummary]() to check the state of the stream, which is returned in `StreamStatus`.

            `MergeShards` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a `MergeShards` request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the `StreamStatus` to `UPDATING`. After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the `StreamStatus` to `ACTIVE`. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the `UPDATING` state.

            You use [DescribeStreamSummary]() and the [ListShards]() APIs to determine the shard IDs that are specified in the `MergeShards` request.

            If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using [CreateStream](), [DeleteStream](), `MergeShards`, or [SplitShard](), you receive a `LimitExceededException`.

            `MergeShards` has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or *producers*. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.

            You can create your data stream using either on-demand or provisioned capacity mode. Data streams with an on-demand mode require no capacity planning and automatically scale to handle gigabytes of write and read throughput per minute. With the on-demand mode, Kinesis Data Streams automatically manages the shards in order to provide the necessary throughput.

            If you'd still like to proactively scale your on-demand data stream’s capacity, you can unlock the warm throughput feature for on-demand data streams by enabling `MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment` for your account. Once your account has `MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment` enabled, you can specify the warm throughput in MiB per second that your stream can support in writes.

            For the data streams with a provisioned mode, you must specify the number of shards for the data stream. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards.

            The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the Amazon Web Services account used by the application. It is also scoped by Amazon Web Services Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.

            `CreateStream` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a `CreateStream` request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to `CREATING`. After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to `ACTIVE`. You should perform read and write operations only on an `ACTIVE` stream.

            You receive a `LimitExceededException` when making a `CreateStream` request when you try to do one of the following:

            - Have more than five streams in the `CREATING` state at any point in time.
            - Create more shards than are authorized for your account.

            For the default shard or on-demand throughput limits for an Amazon Web Services account, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*. To increase this limit, [contact Amazon Web Services Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

            You can use [DescribeStreamSummary]() to check the stream status, which is returned in `StreamStatus`.

            [CreateStream]() has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

            You can add tags to the stream when making a `CreateStream` request by setting the `Tags` parameter. If you pass the `Tags` parameter, in addition to having the `kinesis:CreateStream` permission, you must also have the `kinesis:AddTagsToStream` permission for the stream that will be created. The `kinesis:TagResource` permission won’t work to tag streams on creation. Tags will take effect from the `CREATING` status of the stream, but you can't make any updates to the tags until the stream is in `ACTIVE` state.

            Updates the shard count of the specified stream to the specified number of shards. This API is only supported for the data streams with the provisioned capacity mode.

            When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

            Updating the shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to `UPDATING`. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to `ACTIVE`. Depending on the size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is `UPDATING`.

            To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the final shards. These short-lived shards count towards your total shard limit for your account in the Region.

            When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that is a multiple of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify any target value within your shard limit. However, if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling action might take longer to complete.

            This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the following:

            - Scale more than ten times per rolling 24-hour period per stream
            - Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream
            - Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream
            - Scale up to more than 10000 shards in a stream
            - Scale a stream with more than 10000 shards down unless the result is less than 10000 shards
            - Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account
            - Make over 10 TPS. TPS over 10 will trigger the LimitExceededException

            For the default limits for an Amazon Web Services account, see [Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*. To request an increase in the call rate limit, the shard limit for this API, or your overall shard limit, use the [limits form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/v1#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-kinesis).

                When invoking this API, you must use either the `StreamARN` or the `StreamName` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the `StreamARN` input parameter when you invoke this API.

                The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard. Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number, which is assigned when the record is put into the stream.

                You can limit the number of shards returned by each call. For more information, see [Retrieving Shards from a Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-retrieve-shards.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

                There are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned. To process shards in chronological order, use the ID of the parent shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard.

                    If you don't specify this parameter, the default behavior for `DescribeStream` is to describe the stream starting with the first shard in the stream.
                generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                    If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                    This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
                limit: The maximum number of shards to return in a single call. The default value is 100. If you specify a value greater than 100, at most 100 results are returned.
                max-items: |-
                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                stream-arn: The ARN of the stream.
                stream-name: The name of the stream to describe.
