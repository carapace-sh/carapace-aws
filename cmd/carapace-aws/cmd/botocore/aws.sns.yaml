      documentation:
        command: Verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier `Subscribe` action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the `AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe` flag is set to "true".
        flag:
            authenticate-on-unsubscribe: Disallows unauthenticated unsubscribes of the subscription. If the value of this parameter is `true` and the request has an Amazon Web Services signature, then only the topic owner and the subscription owner can unsubscribe the endpoint. The unsubscribe action requires Amazon Web Services authentication.

        command: Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can create at most 100,000 standard topics (at most 1,000 FIFO topics). For more information, see [Creating an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html) in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*. This action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns a topic with the specified name, that topic's ARN is returned without creating a new topic.
        flag:
            attributes: "A map of attributes with their corresponding values.\n\nThe following lists names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the `CreateTopic` action uses:\n\n- `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.\n- `DisplayName` – The display name to use for a topic with SMS subscriptions.\n- `Policy` – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.\n- `TracingConfig` – Tracing mode of an Amazon SNS topic. By default `TracingConfig` is set to `PassThrough`, and the topic passes through the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its subscriptions. If set to `Active`, Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray segment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the tracing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.\n- HTTP\n  \n  - `HTTPSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n  - `HTTPSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n  - `HTTPFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n- Amazon Data Firehose\n  \n  - `FirehoseSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Data Firehose endpoint.\n  - `FirehoseSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Data Firehose endpoint.\n  - `FirehoseFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Data Firehose endpoint.\n- Lambda\n  \n  - `LambdaSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n  - `LambdaSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n  - `LambdaFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n- Platform application endpoint\n  \n  - `ApplicationSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to a platform application endpoint.\n  - `ApplicationSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an platform application endpoint.\n  - `ApplicationFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an platform application endpoint.\n  \n  In addition to being able to configure topic attributes for message delivery status of notification messages sent to Amazon SNS application endpoints, you can also configure application attributes for the delivery status of push notification messages sent to push notification services.\n  \n  For example, For more information, see [Using Amazon SNS Application Attributes for Message Delivery Status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-msg-status.html).\n- Amazon SQS\n  \n  - `SQSSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n  - `SQSSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n  - `SQSFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n\nThe &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;SuccessFeedbackRoleArn and &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;FailureFeedbackRoleArn attributes are used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf. The &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;SuccessFeedbackSampleRate attribute is for specifying the sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages. After you configure the &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;FailureFeedbackRoleArn attribute, then all failed message deliveries generate CloudWatch Logs.\n\nThe following attribute applies only to [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html):\n\n- `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms). For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the *Key Management Service API Reference*.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [FIFO topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html):\n\n- `ArchivePolicy` – The policy that sets the retention period for messages stored in the message archive of an Amazon SNS FIFO topic.\n- `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.\n  \n  - By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the [Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) action.\n  - When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).\n    \n    (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the `Publish` action.\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- `FifoThroughputScope` – Enables higher throughput for your FIFO topic by adjusting the scope of deduplication. This attribute has two possible values:\n  \n  - `Topic` – The scope of message deduplication is across the entire topic. This is the default value and maintains existing behavior, with a maximum throughput of 3000 messages per second or 20MB per second, whichever comes first.\n  - `MessageGroup` – The scope of deduplication is within each individual message group, which enables higher throughput per topic subject to regional quotas. For more information on quotas or to request an increase, see [Amazon SNS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sns.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference."

            When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your Amazon Web Services account is in the *SMS sandbox*. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for you to try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS sender. While your Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you can send SMS messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more information, including how to move out of the sandbox to send messages without restrictions, see [SMS sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.

      documentation:

            Publishes up to 10 messages to the specified topic in a single batch. This is a batch version of the `Publish` API. If you try to send more than 10 messages in a single batch request, you will receive a `TooManyEntriesInBatchRequest` exception.

            For FIFO topics, multiple messages within a single batch are published in the order they are sent, and messages are deduplicated within the batch and across batches for five minutes.

            The result of publishing each message is reported individually in the response. Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200.

            The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 256 KB (262,144 bytes).

            The `PublishBatch` API can send up to 10 messages at a time. If you attempt to send more than 10 messages in one request, you will encounter a `TooManyEntriesInBatchRequest` exception. In such cases, split your messages into multiple requests, each containing no more than 10 messages.

            Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the `param.n` notation. Values of `n` are integers starting from **1**. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

            `&AttributeName.1=first`

            `&AttributeName.2=second`

            If you send a batch message to a topic, Amazon SNS publishes the batch message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the batch message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint.

            When a `messageId` is returned, the batch message is saved, and Amazon SNS immediately delivers the message to subscribers.

If an ending point was specified in the `ReplayPolicy` then the subscription will no longer receive newly published messages.\n  - `In progress` – The replay is currently replaying the selected messages.\n  - `Failed` – The replay was unable to complete.\n  - `Pending` – The default state while the replay initiates."

            attributes: |-
                The default settings for sending SMS messages from your Amazon Web Services account. You can set values for the following attribute names:

                `MonthlySpendLimit` – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.

                Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.

                By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an [SNS Limit Increase case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sns). For **New limit value**, enter your desired monthly spend limit. In the **Use Case Description** field, explain that you are requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.

                `DeliveryStatusIAMRole` – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.

                `DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate` – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to `0`. To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to `10`.

                `DefaultSenderID` – A string, such as your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must contain at least one letter.

                `DefaultSMSType` – The type of SMS message that you will send by default. You can assign the following values:

                - `Promotional` – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost.
                - `Transactional` – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.

                `UsageReportS3Bucket` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes the following information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by your Amazon Web Services account:

                - Time that the message was published (in UTC)
                - Message ID
                - Destination phone number
                - Message type
                - Delivery status
                - Message price (in USD)
                - Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for a single message)
                - Total number of parts

                To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principal to perform the `s3:PutObject` and `s3:GetBucketLocation` actions.

                For an example bucket policy and usage report, see [Monitoring SMS Activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sms_stats.html) in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.

        command: |-
            Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic, a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone number, or a message to a mobile platform endpoint (when you specify the `TargetArn`).

            If you send a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint.

            When a `messageId` is returned, the message is saved and Amazon SNS immediately delivers it to subscribers.

            To use the `Publish` action for publishing a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the `CreatePlatformEndpoint` action.

            For more information about formatting messages, see [Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html).

            You can publish messages only to topics and endpoints in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

            message: "The message you want to send.\n\nIf you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the `MessageStructure` parameter to `json` and use a JSON object for the `Message` parameter.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters).\n- For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or 70 UCS-2 characters.\n  \n  If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at whole-word boundaries.\n  \n  The total size limit for a single SMS `Publish` action is 1,600 characters.\n\nJSON-specific constraints:\n\n- Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values.\n- The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages.\n- Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending).\n- Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, \"\", is allowed).\n- Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).\n- Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.\n- Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored.\n- Duplicate keys are not allowed.\n- Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the `Publish` call to return an error (no partial delivery)."
            message-attributes: Message attributes for Publish action.
            message-deduplication-id: "- This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The `MessageDeduplicationId` can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters `(a-z, A-Z, 0-9)` and punctuation ``(!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~)``.\n- Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`, which is a token used for deduplication of sent messages within the 5 minute minimum deduplication interval.\n- The scope of deduplication depends on the `FifoThroughputScope` attribute, when set to `Topic` the message deduplication scope is across the entire topic, when set to `MessageGroup` the message deduplication scope is within each individual message group.\n- If a message with a particular `MessageDeduplicationId` is sent successfully, subsequent messages within the deduplication scope and interval, with the same `MessageDeduplicationId`, are accepted successfully but aren't delivered.\n- Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`:\n  \n  - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.\n  - If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your topic, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).\n  - If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the topic doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails with an error.\n  - If the topic has a `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.\n- When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication scope and interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n- If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled, and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is the same as the one generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as duplicates, within the deduplication scope and interval, and only one copy of the message is delivered."

                The `MessageGroupId` can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters `(a-z, A-Z, 0-9)` and punctuation ``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)``.

                For FIFO topics: The `MessageGroupId` is a tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). Every message must include a `MessageGroupId`.

                For standard topics: The `MessageGroupId` is optional and is forwarded only to Amazon SQS standard subscriptions to activate [fair queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-fair-queues.html). The `MessageGroupId` is not used for, or sent to, any other endpoint types. When provided, the same validation rules apply as for FIFO topics.
            message-structure: |-
                Set `MessageStructure` to `json` if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set `MessageStructure` to `json`, the value of the `Message` parameter must:

                - be a syntactically valid JSON object; and
                - contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value that is a string.

                You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").

                Valid value: `json`
            phone-number: |-
                The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164 format.

                If you don't specify a value for the `PhoneNumber` parameter, you must specify a value for the `TargetArn` or `TopicArn` parameters.
            subject: |-
                Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints.

                Constraints: Subjects must be UTF-8 text with no line breaks or control characters, and less than 100 characters long.
            target-arn: If you don't specify a value for the `TargetArn` parameter, you must specify a value for the `PhoneNumber` or `TopicArn` parameters.

By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.\n- `TracingConfig` – Tracing mode of an Amazon SNS topic. By default `TracingConfig` is set to `PassThrough`, and the topic passes through the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its subscriptions. If set to `Active`, Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray segment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the tracing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.\n- HTTP\n  \n  - `HTTPSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n  - `HTTPSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n  - `HTTPFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n- Amazon Data Firehose\n  \n  - `FirehoseSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Data Firehose endpoint.\n  - `FirehoseSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Data Firehose endpoint.\n  - `FirehoseFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Data Firehose endpoint.\n- Lambda\n  \n  - `LambdaSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n  - `LambdaSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n  - `LambdaFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n- Platform application endpoint\n  \n  - `ApplicationSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an platform application endpoint.\n  - `ApplicationSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an platform application endpoint.\n  - `ApplicationFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an platform application endpoint.\n  \n  In addition to being able to configure topic attributes for message delivery status of notification messages sent to Amazon SNS application endpoints, you can also configure application attributes for the delivery status of push notification messages sent to push notification services.\n  \n  For example, For more information, see [Using Amazon SNS Application Attributes for Message Delivery Status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-msg-status.html).\n- Amazon SQS\n  \n  - `SQSSuccessFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n  - `SQSSuccessFeedbackSampleRate` – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n  - `SQSFailureFeedbackRoleArn` – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n\nThe &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;SuccessFeedbackRoleArn and &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;FailureFeedbackRoleArn attributes are used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf. The &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;SuccessFeedbackSampleRate attribute is for specifying the sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages. After you configure the &lt;ENDPOINT&gt;FailureFeedbackRoleArn attribute, then all failed message deliveries generate CloudWatch Logs.\n\nThe following attribute applies only to [server-side-encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html):\n\n- `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms). For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the *Key Management Service API Reference*.\n- `SignatureVersion` – The signature version corresponds to the hashing algorithm used while creating the signature of the notifications, subscription confirmations, or unsubscribe confirmation messages sent by Amazon SNS. By default, `SignatureVersion` is set to `1`.\n\nThe following attribute applies only to [FIFO topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html):\n\n- `ArchivePolicy` – The policy that sets the retention period for messages stored in the message archive of an Amazon SNS FIFO topic.\n- `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.\n  \n  - By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the [Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) action.\n  - When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).\n    \n    (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the `Publish` action.\n\n<!--THE END-->\n\n- `FifoThroughputScope` – Enables higher throughput for your FIFO topic by adjusting the scope of deduplication. This attribute has two possible values:\n  \n  - `Topic` – The scope of message deduplication is across the entire topic. This is the default value and maintains existing behavior, with a maximum throughput of 3000 messages per second or 20MB per second, whichever comes first.\n  - `MessageGroup` – The scope of deduplication is within each individual message group, which enables higher throughput per topic subject to regional quotas. For more information on quotas or to request an increase, see [Amazon SNS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sns.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference."

            When you use topic tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

            - Adding more than 50 tags to a topic isn't recommended.
            - Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SNS interprets tags as character strings.
            - Tags are case-sensitive.
            - A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.
            - Tagging actions are limited to 10 TPS per Amazon Web Services account, per Amazon Web Services Region. If your application requires a higher throughput, file a [technical support request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=technical).
