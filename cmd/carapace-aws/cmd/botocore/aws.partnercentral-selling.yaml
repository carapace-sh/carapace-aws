            Creates an `Opportunity` record in Partner Central. Use this operation to create a potential business opportunity for submission to Amazon Web Services. Creating an opportunity sets `Lifecycle.ReviewStatus` to `Pending Submission`.

            To submit an opportunity, follow these steps:

            1. To create the opportunity, use `CreateOpportunity`.
            2. To associate a solution with the opportunity, use `AssociateOpportunity`.
            3. To start the engagement with AWS, use `StartEngagementFromOpportunity`.

            After submission, you can't edit the opportunity until the review is complete. But opportunities in the `Pending Submission` state must have complete details. You can update the opportunity while it's in the `Pending Submission` state.

            There's a set of mandatory fields to create opportunities, but consider providing optional fields to enrich the opportunity record.
        flag:

                Default: None

                Best practice: To help ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts, use a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) as the `ClientToken`. You can use standard libraries from most programming languages to generate this. If you use the same client token, the API returns the following error: "Conflicting client token submitted for a new request body."

            marketing: This object contains marketing details and is optional for an opportunity.
            national-security: Indicates whether the `Opportunity` pertains to a national security project. This field must be set to `true` only when the customer's industry is *Government*. Additional privacy and security measures apply during the review and management process for opportunities marked as `NationalSecurity`.

                Specifies the opportunity type as a renewal, new, or expansion.

                Opportunity types:

                - New opportunity: Represents a new business opportunity with a potential customer that's not previously engaged with your solutions or services.
                - Renewal opportunity: Represents an opportunity to renew an existing contract or subscription with a current customer, ensuring continuity of service.
                - Expansion opportunity: Represents an opportunity to expand the scope of an existing contract or subscription, either by adding new services or increasing the volume of existing services for a current customer.
            origin: 'Specifies the origin of the opportunity, indicating if it was sourced from Amazon Web Services or the partner. For all opportunities created with `Catalog: AWS`, this field must only be `Partner Referral`. However, when using `Catalog: Sandbox`, you can set this field to `AWS Referral` to simulate Amazon Web Services referral creation. This allows Amazon Web Services-originated flows testing in the sandbox catalog.'
            partner-opportunity-identifier: |-
                Specifies the opportunity's unique identifier in the partner's CRM system. This value is essential to track and reconcile because it's included in the outbound payload to the partner.

                This field allows partners to link an opportunity to their CRM, which helps to ensure seamless integration and accurate synchronization between the Partner Central API and the partner's internal systems.

            This request accepts a list of filters that retrieve opportunity subsets as well as sort options. This feature is available to partners from [Partner Central](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/) using the `ListOpportunities` API action.

            To synchronize your system with Amazon Web Services, list only the opportunities that were newly created or updated. We recommend you rely on events emitted by the service into your Amazon Web Services account’s Amazon EventBridge default event bus. You can also use the `ListOpportunities` action.

            We recommend the following approach:

            1. Find the latest `LastModifiedDate` that you stored, and only use the values that came from Amazon Web Services. Don’t use values generated by your system.
            2. When you send a `ListOpportunities` request, submit the date in ISO 8601 format in the `AfterLastModifiedDate` filter.
            3. Amazon Web Services only returns opportunities created or updated on or after that date and time. Use `NextToken` to iterate over all pages.

                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            customer-company-name: Filters the opportunities based on the customer's company name. This allows partners to search for opportunities associated with a specific customer by matching the provided company name string.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            identifier: Filters the opportunities based on the opportunity identifier. This allows partners to retrieve specific opportunities by providing their unique identifiers, ensuring precise results.
            last-modified-date: Filters the opportunities based on their last modified date. This filter helps retrieve opportunities that were updated after the specified date, allowing partners to track recent changes or updates.
            life-cycle-review-status: Filters the opportunities based on their current lifecycle approval status. Use this filter to retrieve opportunities with statuses such as `Pending Submission`, `In Review`, `Action Required`, or `Approved`.
            life-cycle-stage: Filters the opportunities based on their lifecycle stage. This filter allows partners to retrieve opportunities at various stages in the sales cycle, such as `Qualified`, `Technical Validation`, `Business Validation`, or `Closed Won`.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                Specifies the maximum number of results to return in a single call. This limits the number of opportunities returned in the response to avoid providing too many results at once.

                Default: 20
            next-token: A pagination token used to retrieve the next set of results in subsequent calls. This token is included in the response only if there are additional result pages available.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort: An object that specifies how the response is sorted. The default `Sort.SortBy` value is `LastModifiedDate`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
