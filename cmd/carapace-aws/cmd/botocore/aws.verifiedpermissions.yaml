            max-results: |-
                Specifies the total number of results that you want included in each response. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the `NextToken` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next set of results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

                If you do not specify this parameter, the operation defaults to 10 policies per response. You can specify a maximum of 50 policies per response.
            next-token: Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a `NextToken` response in the previous request.

You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. In Verified Permissions, policy stores can be tagged.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the TagResource action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Adds an identity source to a policy store–an Amazon Cognito user pool or OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP).

            After you create an identity source, you can use the identities provided by the IdP as proxies for the principal in authorization queries that use the [IsAuthorizedWithToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_IsAuthorizedWithToken.html) or [BatchIsAuthorizedWithToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_BatchIsAuthorizedWithToken.html) API operations. These identities take the form of tokens that contain claims about the user, such as IDs, attributes and group memberships. Identity sources provide identity (ID) tokens and access tokens. Verified Permissions derives information about your user and session from token claims. Access tokens provide action `context` to your policies, and ID tokens provide principal `Attributes`.

            Tokens from an identity source user continue to be usable until they expire. Token revocation and resource deletion have no effect on the validity of a token in your policy store

            To reference a user from this identity source in your Cedar policies, refer to the following syntax examples.

            - Amazon Cognito user pool: `Namespace::[Entity type]::[User pool ID]|[user principal attribute]`, for example `MyCorp::User::us-east-1_EXAMPLE|a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111`.
            - OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider: `Namespace::[Entity type]::[entityIdPrefix]|[user principal attribute]`, for example `MyCorp::User::MyOIDCProvider|a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222`.

            Verified Permissions is [*eventually consistent*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) . It can take a few seconds for a new or changed element to propagate through the service and be visible in the results of other Verified Permissions operations.

            Although [Cedar supports multiple namespaces](https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/schema/schema.html#namespace), Verified Permissions currently supports only one namespace per policy store.

            Verified Permissions is [*eventually consistent*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) . It can take a few seconds for a new or changed element to propagate through the service and be visible in the results of other Verified Permissions operations.

            client-token: |-
                Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

                If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an `ConflictException` error.

                Verified Permissions recognizes a `ClientToken` for eight hours. After eight hours, the next request with the same parameters performs the operation again regardless of the value of `ClientToken`.

                Specifies the validation setting for this policy store.

                Currently, the only valid and required value is `Mode`.

                We recommend that you turn on `STRICT` mode only after you define a schema. If a schema doesn't exist, then `STRICT` mode causes any policy to fail validation, and Verified Permissions rejects the policy. You can turn off validation by using the [UpdatePolicyStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_UpdatePolicyStore). Then, when you have a schema defined, use [UpdatePolicyStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_UpdatePolicyStore) again to turn validation back on.

            Makes a series of decisions about multiple authorization requests for one principal or resource. Each request contains the equivalent content of an `IsAuthorized` request: principal, action, resource, and context. Either the `principal` or the `resource` parameter must be identical across all requests. For example, Verified Permissions won't evaluate a pair of requests where `bob` views `photo1` and `alice` views `photo2`. Authorization of `bob` to view `photo1` and `photo2`, or `bob` and `alice` to view `photo1`, are valid batches.

            The request is evaluated against all policies in the specified policy store that match the entities that you declare. The result of the decisions is a series of `Allow` or `Deny` responses, along with the IDs of the policies that produced each decision.

            The `entities` of a `BatchIsAuthorized` API request can contain up to 100 principals and up to 100 resources. The `requests` of a `BatchIsAuthorized` API request can contain up to 30 requests.

            The `BatchIsAuthorized` operation doesn't have its own IAM permission. To authorize this operation for Amazon Web Services principals, include the permission `verifiedpermissions:IsAuthorized` in their IAM policies.

            Makes a series of decisions about multiple authorization requests for one token. The principal in this request comes from an external identity source in the form of an identity or access token, formatted as a [JSON web token (JWT)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). The information in the parameters can also define additional context that Verified Permissions can include in the evaluations.

            The request is evaluated against all policies in the specified policy store that match the entities that you provide in the entities declaration and in the token. The result of the decisions is a series of `Allow` or `Deny` responses, along with the IDs of the policies that produced each decision.

            The `entities` of a `BatchIsAuthorizedWithToken` API request can contain up to 100 resources and up to 99 user groups. The `requests` of a `BatchIsAuthorizedWithToken` API request can contain up to 30 requests.

            The `BatchIsAuthorizedWithToken` operation doesn't have its own IAM permission. To authorize this operation for Amazon Web Services principals, include the permission `verifiedpermissions:IsAuthorizedWithToken` in their IAM policies.

If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the `NextToken` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next set of results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

                If you do not specify this parameter, the operation defaults to 10 policy stores per response. You can specify a maximum of 50 policy stores per response.
            next-token: Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a `NextToken` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's `NextToken` response to request the next page of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Creates a Cedar policy and saves it in the specified policy store. You can create either a static policy or a policy linked to a policy template.

            - To create a static policy, provide the Cedar policy text in the `StaticPolicy` section of the `PolicyDefinition`.
            - To create a policy that is dynamically linked to a policy template, specify the policy template ID and the principal and resource to associate with this policy in the `templateLinked` section of the `PolicyDefinition`. If the policy template is ever updated, any policies linked to the policy template automatically use the updated template.

            Creating a policy causes it to be validated against the schema in the policy store. If the policy doesn't pass validation, the operation fails and the policy isn't stored.
