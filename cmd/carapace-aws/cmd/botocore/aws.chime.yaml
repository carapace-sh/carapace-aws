            Users suspended from a `Team` account are disassociated from the account,but they can continue to use Amazon Chime as free users. To remove the suspension from suspended `Team` account users, invite them to the `Team` account again. You can use the [InviteUsers]() action to do so.

            Users suspended from an `EnterpriseLWA` account are immediately signed out of Amazon Chime and can no longer sign in. To remove the suspension from suspended `EnterpriseLWA` account users, use the [BatchUnsuspendUser]() action.

            To sign out users without suspending them, use the [LogoutUser]() action.
