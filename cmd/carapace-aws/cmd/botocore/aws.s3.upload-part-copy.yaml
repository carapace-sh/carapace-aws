flags:
    --bucket=!: The bucket name.
    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided.
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided.
    --copy-source-if-match=: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
    --copy-source-if-modified-since=: Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
    --copy-source-if-none-match=: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.
    --copy-source-if-unmodified-since=: Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
    --copy-source-range=: The range of bytes to copy from the source object.
    --copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm=: Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example, `AES256`).
    --copy-source-sse-customer-key-m-d5=: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    --copy-source-sse-customer-key=: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object.
    --copy-source=!: Specifies the source object for the copy operation.
    --expected-bucket-owner=: The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner.
    --expected-source-bucket-owner=: The account ID of the expected source bucket owner.
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.
    --key=!: Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.
    --part-number=!: Part number of part being copied.
    --request-payer=: ""
    --sse-customer-algorithm=: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
    --sse-customer-key-m-d5=: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    --sse-customer-key=: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
    --upload-id=!: Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.
