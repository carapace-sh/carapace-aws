            Creates a rescore execution plan. A rescore execution plan is an Amazon Kendra Intelligent Ranking resource used for provisioning the `Rescore` API. You set the number of capacity units that you require for Amazon Kendra Intelligent Ranking to rescore or re-rank a search service's results.

            For an example of using the `CreateRescoreExecutionPlan` API, including using the Python and Java SDKs, see [Semantically ranking a search service's results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/search-service-rerank.html).
        flag:
            capacity-units: You can set additional capacity units to meet the needs of your rescore execution plan. You are given a single capacity unit by default. If you want to use the default capacity, you don't set additional capacity units. For more information on the default capacity and additional capacity units, see [Adjusting capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/adjusting-capacity.html).
