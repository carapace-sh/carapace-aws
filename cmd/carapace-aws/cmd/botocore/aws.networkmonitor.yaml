        command: |-
            Creates a monitor between a source subnet and destination IP address. Within a monitor you'll create one or more probes that monitor network traffic between your source Amazon Web Services VPC subnets and your destination IP addresses. Each probe then aggregates and sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.

            You can also create a monitor with probes using this command. For each probe, you define the following:

            - `source`—The subnet IDs where the probes will be created.
            - `destination`— The target destination IP address for the probe.
            - `destinationPort`—Required only if the protocol is `TCP`.
            - `protocol`—The communication protocol between the source and destination. This will be either `TCP` or `ICMP`.
            - `packetSize`—The size of the packets. This must be a number between `56` and `8500`.
            - (Optional) `tags` —Key-value pairs created and assigned to the probe.
        flag:
            aggregation-period: The time, in seconds, that metrics are aggregated and sent to Amazon CloudWatch. Valid values are either `30` or `60`. `60` is the default if no period is chosen.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Updates a monitor probe. This action requires both the `monitorName` and `probeId` parameters. Run `ListMonitors` to get a list of monitor names. Run `GetMonitor` to get a list of probes and probe IDs.

            You can update the following para create a monitor with probes using this command. For each probe, you define the following:

            - `state`—The state of the probe.
            - `destination`— The target destination IP address for the probe.
            - `destinationPort`—Required only if the protocol is `TCP`.
            - `protocol`—The communication protocol between the source and destination. This will be either `TCP` or `ICMP`.
            - `packetSize`—The size of the packets. This must be a number between `56` and `8500`.
            - (Optional) `tags` —Key-value pairs created and assigned to the probe.

        Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active network monitoring service that identifies if a network issues exists within the Amazon Web Services network or your own company network. Within Network Monitor you'll choose the source VPCs and subnets from the Amazon Web Services network in which you operate and then you'll choose the destination IP addresses from your on-premises network. From these sources and destinations, Network Monitor creates a monitor containing all the possible source and destination combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor. These probes then monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues might be affecting your traffic.

        Before you begin, ensure the Amazon Web Services CLI is configured in the Amazon Web Services Account where you will create the Network Monitor resource. Network Monitor doesn’t support creation on cross-account resources, but you can create a Network Monitor in any subnet belonging to a VPC owned by your Account.

        For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/what-is-network-monitor.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.
