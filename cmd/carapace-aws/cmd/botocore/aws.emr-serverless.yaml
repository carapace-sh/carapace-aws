                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            identity-center-configuration: Specifies the IAM Identity Center configuration used to enable or disable trusted identity propagation. When provided, this configuration determines how the application interacts with IAM Identity Center for user authentication and access control.
            image-configuration: The image configuration to be used for all worker types. You can either set this parameter or `imageConfiguration` for each worker type in `WorkerTypeSpecificationInput`.
            initial-capacity: The capacity to initialize when the application is updated.
            interactive-configuration: The interactive configuration object that contains new interactive use cases when the application is updated.
            maximum-capacity: The maximum capacity to allocate when the application is updated. This is cumulative across all workers at any given point in time during the lifespan of the application. No new resources will be created once any one of the defined limits is hit.
            monitoring-configuration: The configuration setting for monitoring.
            network-configuration: ""
            release-label: The Amazon EMR release label for the application. You can change the release label to use a different release of Amazon EMR.
            runtime-configuration: The [Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr-serverless/latest/APIReference/API_Configuration.html) specifications to use when updating an application. Each configuration consists of a classification and properties. This configuration is applied across all the job runs submitted under the application.
            scheduler-configuration: The scheduler configuration for batch and streaming jobs running on this application. Supported with release labels emr-7.0.0 and above.
            worker-type-specifications: The key-value pairs that specify worker type to `WorkerTypeSpecificationInput`. This parameter must contain all valid worker types for a Spark or Hive application. Valid worker types include `Driver` and `Executor` for Spark applications and `HiveDriver` and `TezTask` for Hive applications. You can either set image details in this parameter for each worker type, or in `imageConfiguration` for all worker types.
