            Translates an encryption key between different wrapping keys without importing the key into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.

            This operation can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is a need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. It translates short-lived transaction keys such as Pin Encryption Key (PEK) generated for each transaction and wrapped with an ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) derived wrapping key to another KEK (Key Encryption Key) wrapping key.

            Before using this operation, you must first request the public key certificate of the ECC key pair generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography to establish an ECDH key agreement. In `TranslateKeyData`, the service uses its own ECC key pair, public certificate of receiving ECC key pair, and the key derivation parameters to generate a derived key. The service uses this derived key to unwrap the incoming transaction key received as a TR31WrappedKeyBlock and re-wrap using a user provided KEK to generate an outgoing Tr31WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on establishing ECDH derived keys, see the [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/create-keys.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            ARQC generation is done outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and is typically generated on a point of sale terminal for an EMV chip card to obtain payment authorization during transaction time. For ARQC verification, you must first import the ARQC generated outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling [ImportKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html). This operation uses the imported ARQC and an major encryption key (DUKPT) created by calling [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html) to either provide a boolean ARQC verification result or provide an APRC (Authorization Response Cryptogram) response using Method 1 or Method 2. The `ARPC_METHOD_1` uses `AuthResponseCode` to generate ARPC and `ARPC_METHOD_2` uses `CardStatusUpdate` to generate ARPC.

For more information, see [Decrypt data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/decrypt-data.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            You can use an decryption key generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, or you can import your own decryption key by calling [ImportKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html). For this operation, the key must have `KeyModesOfUse` set to `Decrypt`. In asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography decrypts the ciphertext using the private component of the asymmetric encryption key pair. For data encryption outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can export the public component of the asymmetric key pair by calling [GetPublicCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKeyCertificate.html).

            This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic decryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To decrypt using dynamic keys, the `keyARN` is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped decryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see [Using Dynamic Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/use-cases-acquirers-dynamickeys.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            For symmetric and DUKPT decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `TDES` and `AES` algorithms. For EMV decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `TDES` algorithms. For asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `RSA`.

            When you use TDES or TDES DUKPT, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 8 bytes. For AES or AES DUKPT, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For RSA, it sould be equal to the key size unless padding is enabled.

            Encrypts plaintext data to ciphertext using a symmetric (TDES, AES), asymmetric (RSA), or derived (DUKPT or EMV) encryption key scheme. For more information, see [Encrypt data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/encrypt-data.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            You can generate an encryption key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html). You can import your own encryption key by calling [ImportKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html).

            For this operation, the key must have `KeyModesOfUse` set to `Encrypt`. In asymmetric encryption, plaintext is encrypted using public component. You can import the public component of an asymmetric key pair created outside Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling [ImportKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html).

            This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic encryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To encrypt using dynamic keys, the `keyARN` is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped encryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see [Using Dynamic Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/use-cases-acquirers-dynamickeys.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            For symmetric and DUKPT encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `TDES` and `AES` algorithms. For EMV encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `TDES` algorithms.For asymmetric encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports `RSA`.

            When you use TDES or TDES DUKPT, the plaintext data length must be a multiple of 8 bytes. For AES or AES DUKPT, the plaintext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For RSA, it sould be equal to the key size unless padding is enabled.

            To encrypt using DUKPT, you must already have a BDK (Base Derivation Key) key in your account with `KeyModesOfUse` set to `DeriveKey`, or you can generate a new DUKPT key by calling [CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html). To encrypt using EMV, you must already have an IMK (Issuer Master Key) key in your account with `KeyModesOfUse` set to `DeriveKey`.

            This operation generates an authenticated issuer script response by appending the incoming message data (APDU command) with the target encrypted PIN block in ISO2 format. The command structure and method to send the issuer script update to the card is not defined by this operation and is typically determined by the applicable payment card scheme.

            The primary inputs to this operation include the incoming new encrypted pinblock, PIN encryption key (PEK), issuer master key (IMK), primary account number (PAN), and the payment card derivation method.

            The operation uses two issuer master keys - secure messaging for confidentiality (IMK-SMC) and secure messaging for integrity (IMK-SMI). The SMC key is used to internally derive a key to secure the pin, while SMI key is used to internally derive a key to authenticate the script reponse as per the [EMV 4.4 - Book 2 - Security and Key Management](https://www.emvco.com/specifications/) specification.

            This operation supports Amex, EMV2000, EMVCommon, Mastercard and Visa derivation methods, each requiring specific input parameters. Users must follow the specific derivation method and input parameters defined by the respective payment card scheme.

            Use [GenerateMac]() operation when sending a script update to an EMV card that does not involve PIN change. When assigning IAM permissions, it is important to understand that [EncryptData]() using EMV keys and [GenerateMac]() perform similar functions to this command.

                The `ISO_Format_0` PIN block format is equivalent to the ANSI X9.8, VISA-1, and ECI-1 PIN block formats. It is similar to a VISA-4 PIN block format. It supports a PIN from 4 to 12 digits in length.

                The `ISO_Format_3` PIN block format is the same as `ISO_Format_0` except that the fill digits are random values from 10 to 15.

                The `ISO_Format_4` PIN block format is the only one supporting AES encryption. It is similar to `ISO_Format_3` but doubles the pin block length by padding with fill digit A and random values from 10 to 15.

            Translates encrypted PIN block from and to ISO 9564 formats 0,1,3,4. For more information, see [Translate PIN data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/translate-pin-data.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            PIN block translation involves changing a PIN block from one encryption key to another and optionally change its format. PIN block translation occurs entirely within the HSM boundary and PIN data never enters or leaves Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography in clear text. The encryption key transformation can be from PEK (Pin Encryption Key) to BDK (Base Derivation Key) for DUKPT or from BDK for DUKPT to PEK.

            Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography also supports use of dynamic keys and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) based key exchange for this operation.

            Dynamic keys allow you to pass a PEK as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. They can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To translate PIN block using dynamic keys, the `keyARN` is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped PEK. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of P0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see [Using Dynamic Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/use-cases-acquirers-dynamickeys.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            Using ECDH key exchange, you can receive cardholder selectable PINs into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The ECDH derived key protects the incoming PIN block, which is translated to a PEK encrypted PIN block for use within the service. You can also use ECDH for reveal PIN, wherein the service translates the PIN block from PEK to a ECDH derived encryption key. For more information on establishing ECDH derived keys, see the [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/create-keys.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            The allowed combinations of PIN block format translations are guided by PCI. It is important to note that not all encrypted PIN block formats (example, format 1) require PAN (Primary Account Number) as input. And as such, PIN block format that requires PAN (example, formats 0,3,4) cannot be translated to a format (format 1) that does not require a PAN for generation.

            For information about valid keys for this operation, see [Understanding key attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-validattributes.html) and [Key types for specific data operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/crypto-ops-validkeys-ops.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

            Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography currently supports ISO PIN block 4 translation for PIN block built using legacy PAN length. That is, PAN is the right most 12 digits excluding the check digits.
