                When using this parameter, be sure the filter resource is `ACTIVE`.
            filter-values: |-
                The values to use when filtering recommendations. For each placeholder parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a comma.

                For filter expressions that use an `INCLUDE` element to include actions, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For filters with expressions that use an `EXCLUDE` element to exclude actions, you can omit the `filter-values`. In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.

            Returns a list of recommended items. For campaigns, the campaign's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is required and the required user and item input depends on the recipe type used to create the solution backing the campaign as follows:

            - USER\_PERSONALIZATION - `userId` required, `itemId` not used
            - RELATED\_ITEMS - `itemId` required, `userId` not used

            Campaigns that are backed by a solution created using a recipe of type PERSONALIZED\_RANKING use the API.

            For recommenders, the recommender's ARN is required and the required item and user input depends on the use case (domain-based recipe) backing the recommender. For information on use case requirements see [Choosing recommender use cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-use-cases.html).
