            Retrieves metadata for a Greengrass core device.

            IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send status updates to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core software isn't running on the device, or if device isn't connected to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that device might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp indicates when the device status was last updated.

            Core devices send status updates at the following times:

            - When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts
            - When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon Web Services Cloud
            - When the status of any component on the core device becomes `BROKEN`
            - At a [regular interval that you can configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-nucleus-component.html#greengrass-nucleus-component-configuration-fss), which defaults to 24 hours
            - For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends status updates upon local deployment and cloud deployment

            IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send status updates to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core software isn't running on the device, or if device isn't connected to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that device might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp indicates when the device status was last updated.

            Core devices send status updates at the following times:

            - When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts
            - When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon Web Services Cloud
            - When the status of any component on the core device becomes `BROKEN`
            - At a [regular interval that you can configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-nucleus-component.html#greengrass-nucleus-component-configuration-fss), which defaults to 24 hours
            - For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends status updates upon local deployment and cloud deployment

            Deletes a deployment. To delete an active deployment, you must first cancel it. For more information, see [CancelDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CancelDeployment.html).

            Deleting a deployment doesn't affect core devices that run that deployment, because core devices store the deployment's configuration on the device. Additionally, core devices can roll back to a previous deployment that has been deleted.

            Creates a continuous deployment for a target, which is a Greengrass core device or group of core devices. When you add a new core device to a group of core devices that has a deployment, IoT Greengrass deploys that group's deployment to the new device.

            You can define one deployment for each target. When you create a new deployment for a target that has an existing deployment, you replace the previous deployment. IoT Greengrass applies the new deployment to the target devices.

            Every deployment has a revision number that indicates how many deployment revisions you define for a target. Use this operation to create a new revision of an existing deployment.

            For more information, see the [Create deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/create-deployments.html) in the *IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide*.

        command: |-
            Retrieves a list of components that meet the component, version, and platform requirements of a deployment. Greengrass core devices call this operation when they receive a deployment to identify the components to install.

            This operation identifies components that meet all dependency requirements for a deployment. If the requirements conflict, then this operation returns an error and the deployment fails. For example, this occurs if component `A` requires version `>2.0.0` and component `B` requires version `<2.0.0` of a component dependency.

            When you specify the component candidates to resolve, IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest from the core device with the component's digest in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the digests don't match, then IoT Greengrass specifies to use the version from the Amazon Web Services Cloud.

            To use this operation, you must use the data plane API endpoint and authenticate with an IoT device certificate. For more information, see [IoT Greengrass endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/greengrass.html).

                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

        IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.

        IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage deployments, and core devices.

        For more information, see [What is IoT Greengrass?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html) in the *IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide*.
