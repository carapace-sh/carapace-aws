        command: |-
            Uploads position update data for one or more devices to a tracker resource (up to 10 devices per batch). Amazon Location uses the data when it reports the last known device position and position history. Amazon Location retains location data for 30 days.

            Position updates are handled based on the `PositionFiltering` property of the tracker. When `PositionFiltering` is set to `TimeBased`, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

            When `PositionFiltering` is set to `DistanceBased` filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft).

            When `PositionFiltering` is set to `AccuracyBased` filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If `PositionFiltering` is set to `AccuracyBased` filtering, Amazon Location uses the default value `{ "Horizontal": 0}` when accuracy is not provided on a `DevicePositionUpdate`.

            position-filtering: |-
                Specifies the position filtering for the tracker resource.

                Valid values:

                - `TimeBased` - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, but not every location update is stored. If your update frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.
                - `DistanceBased` - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4 ft), location updates are ignored. Location updates within this area are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of geofence evaluations and historical device positions to paginate through. Distance-based filtering can also reduce the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.
                - `AccuracyBased` - If the device has moved less than the measured accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This can reduce the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map, and can help control your costs by reducing the number of geofence evaluations.

                This field is optional. If not specified, the default value is `TimeBased`.
            pricing-plan: No longer used. If included, the only allowed value is `RequestBasedUsage`.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            You can use the `TagResource` operation with an Amazon Location Service resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the tags already associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that's already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            - `SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions` is part of a previous Amazon Location Service Places API (version 1) which has been superseded by a more intuitive, powerful, and complete API (version 2).
            - The version 2 `Suggest` operation gives better results for typeahead place search suggestions with fuzzy matching, while the version 2 `Autocomplete` operation gives better results for address completion based on partial input.
            - If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, note that the Places API version 2 is found under `geo-places` or `geo_places`, not under `location`.
            - Since Grab is not yet fully supported in Places API version 2, we recommend you continue using API version 1 when using Grab.

            Generates suggestions for addresses and points of interest based on partial or misspelled free-form text. This operation is also known as autocomplete, autosuggest, or fuzzy matching.

            Optional parameters let you narrow your search results by bounding box or country, or bias your search toward a specific position on the globe.

            You can search for suggested place names near a specified position by using `BiasPosition`, or filter results within a bounding box by using `FilterBBox`. These parameters are mutually exclusive; using both `BiasPosition` and `FilterBBox` in the same command returns an error.

                An optional parameter that indicates a preference for place suggestions that are closer to a specified position.

                If provided, this parameter must contain a pair of numbers. The first number represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

                For example, `[-123.1174, 49.2847]` represents the position with longitude `-123.1174` and latitude `49.2847`.

                An optional parameter that limits the search results by returning only suggestions within a specified bounding box.

                If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the southwest corner of the bounding box; the second pair of numbers represents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

                For example, `[-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]` represents a bounding box where the southwest corner has longitude `-12.7935` and latitude `-37.4835`, and the northeast corner has longitude `-12.0684` and latitude `-36.9542`.

            language: |-
                The preferred language used to return results. The value must be a valid [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/search/bcp47) language tag, for example, `en` for English.

                This setting affects the languages used in the results. If no language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the result.

                For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for `Athens, Gr` to get suggestions with the `language` parameter set to `en`. The results found will most likely be returned as `Athens, Greece`.

                If you set the `language` parameter to `el`, for Greek, then the result found will more likely be returned as `Αθήνα, Ελλάδα`.

                If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be in a language that the provider does support.
            max-results: |-
                An optional parameter. The maximum number of results returned per request.

                The default: `5`

                Valid values:

                - `TimeBased` - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, but not every location update is stored. If your update frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.
                - `DistanceBased` - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4 ft), location updates are ignored. Location updates within this distance are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of geofence evaluations and historical device positions to paginate through. Distance-based filtering can also reduce the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.
                - `AccuracyBased` - If the device has moved less than the measured accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps educe the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map, and can help control costs by reducing the number of geofence evaluations.

            Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a given geofence collection.

            This operation always returns an empty response because geofences are asynchronously evaluated. The evaluation determines if the device has entered or exited a geofenced area, and then publishes one of the following events to Amazon EventBridge:

            - `ENTER` if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has entered a geofenced area.
            - `EXIT` if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has exited a geofenced area.

            The last geofence that a device was observed within is tracked for 30 days after the most recent device position update.

            Geofence evaluation uses the given device position. It does not account for the optional `Accuracy` of a `DevicePositionUpdate`.

            The `DeviceID` is used as a string to represent the device. You do not need to have a `Tracker` associated with the `DeviceID`.
