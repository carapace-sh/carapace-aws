For information about rotation, see [Rotate secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html) in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret.

            When rotation is successful, the `AWSPENDING` staging label might be attached to the same version as the `AWSCURRENT` version, or it might not be attached to any version. If the `AWSPENDING` staging label is present but not attached to the same version as `AWSCURRENT`, then any later invocation of `RotateSecret` assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error. When rotation is unsuccessful, the `AWSPENDING` staging label might be attached to an empty secret version.

                If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.

                If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a `ClientRequestToken` and include it in the request.

                This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a [UUID-type](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.

                The default for `RotateImmediately` is `true`. If you don't specify this value, Secrets Manager rotates the secret immediately.

                If you set `RotateImmediately` to `false`, Secrets Manager tests the rotation configuration by running the [`testSecret` step](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html) of the Lambda rotation function. This test creates an `AWSPENDING` version of the secret and then removes it.

                When changing an existing rotation schedule and setting `RotateImmediately` to `false`:

                - If using `AutomaticallyAfterDays` or a `ScheduleExpression` with `rate()`, the previously scheduled rotation might still occur.
                - To prevent unintended rotations, use a `ScheduleExpression` with `cron()` for granular control over rotation windows.

            Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days. The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a `DeletionDate` stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.

            You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the replicas using [RemoveRegionsFromReplication](), and then delete the primary secret. When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately.

            You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging labels from the version using [UpdateSecretVersionStage](). This marks the version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the background.

            To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more information, see [Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets.html).

            Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the permanent delete to occur.

            At any time before recovery window ends, you can use [RestoreSecret]() to remove the `DeletionDate` and cancel the deletion of the secret.

            When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You must first cancel the deletion with [RestoreSecret]() and then you can retrieve the secret.

                Secrets Manager performs the actual deletion with an asynchronous background process, so there might be a short delay before the secret is permanently deleted. If you delete a secret and then immediately create a secret with the same name, use appropriate back off and retry logic.

This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal recovery window before the permanent deletion that Secrets Manager would normally impose with the `RecoveryWindowInDays` parameter. If you delete a secret with the `ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery` parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.

        command: |-
            Creates a new version of your secret by creating a new encrypted value and attaching it to the secret. version can contain a new `SecretString` value or a new `SecretBinary` value.

            Do not call `PutSecretValue` at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager keeps 100 of the most recent versions, but it keeps *all* secret versions created in the last 24 hours. If you call `PutSecretValue` more than once every 10 minutes, you will create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions.

            You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version in `VersionStages`. If you don't include `VersionStages`, then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to this version. If this operation creates the first version for the secret, then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to it. If this operation moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` from another version to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.

            This operation is idempotent. If you call this operation with a `ClientRequestToken` that matches an existing version's VersionId, and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you can't modify an existing version; you can only create new ones.

            Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except `SecretBinary`, `SecretString`, or `RotationToken` because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html).

            **Required permissions:** `secretsmanager:PutSecretValue`.

            When you enter commands in a command shell, there is a risk of the command history being accessed or utilities having access to your command parameters. This is a concern if the command includes the value of a secret.

                A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.

                If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.

                If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a `ClientRequestToken` and include it in the request.

                This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a [UUID-type](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.

                - If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
                - If a version with this value already exists and that version's `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.
                - If a version with this value already exists and the version of the `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values.

                This value becomes the `VersionId` of the new version.

Required for secret rotations using an IAM assumed role or cross-account rotation, in which you rotate a secret in one account by using a Lambda rotation function in another account. In both cases, the rotation function assumes an IAM role to call Secrets Manager, and then Secrets Manager validates the identity using the token. For more information, see [How rotation works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html) and [Rotation by Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_lambda).

If you specify `AWSCURRENT`, and it is already attached to another version, then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.

                If you don't include `VersionStages`, then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to this version.

Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you update the secret value more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions.

            If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` to create a new secret version, Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to the new version. Then it attaches the label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.

            If you call this operation with a `ClientRequestToken` that matches an existing version's `VersionId`, the operation results in an error. You can't modify an existing version, you can only create a new version. To remove a version, remove all staging labels from it. See [UpdateSecretVersionStage]().

            Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except `SecretBinary` or `SecretString` because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html).

            **Required permissions:** `secretsmanager:UpdateSecret`. For more information, see [IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions) and [Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html). If you use a customer managed key, you must also have `kms:GenerateDataKey`, `kms:Encrypt`, and `kms:Decrypt` permissions on the key. If you change the KMS key and you don't have `kms:Encrypt` permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the new key. For more information, see [Secret encryption and decryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/security-encryption.html).

            When you enter commands in a command shell, there is a risk of the command history being accessed or utilities having access to your command parameters. This is a concern if the command includes the value of a secret.

If you don't have `kms:Encrypt` permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the new key. For more information about versions and staging labels, see [Concepts: Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#term_version).

                A key alias is always prefixed by `alias/`, for example `alias/aws/secretsmanager`. For more information, see [About aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/alias-about.html).

                If you set this to an empty string, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use `aws/secretsmanager`. Creating `aws/secretsmanager` can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.

        command: |-
            Creates a new secret. A *secret* can be a password, a set of credentials such as a user name and password, an OAuth token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.

            For secrets that use *managed rotation*, you need to create the secret through the managing service. For more information, see [Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html).

            For information about creating a secret in the console, see [Create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html).

            To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the `SecretString` parameter or the `SecretBinary` parameter, but not both. If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to it.

            For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the `SecretString` matches the [JSON structure of a database secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_secret_json_structure.html).

            If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use `aws/secretsmanager`. Creating `aws/secretsmanager` can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.

            If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then you can't use `aws/secretsmanager` to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer managed KMS key.

            Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except `SecretBinary` or `SecretString` because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html).

            **Required permissions:** `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`. If you include tags in the secret, you also need `secretsmanager:TagResource`. To add replica Regions, you must also have `secretsmanager:ReplicateSecretToRegions`. For more information, see [IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions) and [Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html).

            To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than `aws/secretsmanager`, you need `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permission to the key.

            When you enter commands in a command shell, there is a risk of the command history being accessed or utilities having access to your command parameters.

                Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".

                If you check tags in permissions policies as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an `Access Denied` error. For more information, see [Control access to secrets using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples.html#tag-secrets-abac) and [Limit access to identities with tags that match secrets' tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples.html#auth-and-access_tags2).

            Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Secrets Manager uses staging labels to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. Each staging label can be attached to only one version at a time. To add a staging label to a version when it is already attached to another version, Secrets Manager first removes it from the other version first and then attaches it to this one. For more information about versions and staging labels, see [Concepts: Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#term_version).

            The staging labels that you specify in the `VersionStage` parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels for the version.

            You can move the `AWSCURRENT` staging label to this version by including it in this call.

            Whenever you move `AWSCURRENT`, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.

            If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.

            Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html).
