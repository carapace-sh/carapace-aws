            Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. To send email using this operation, your message must meet the following requirements:

            - The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the operation results in an "Email address not verified" error.
            - If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see [Verifying Email Addresses and Domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*
            - The maximum message size is 10 MB.
            - The message must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format *UserName@\[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), the entire message is rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.
            - The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the `SendEmail` operation several times to send the message to each group.

            For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your *sending quota*). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see [Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/manage-sending-quotas.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*

If you want to send to or from email addresses that contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted in the local part of the email address (the part before the @ sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in [Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html).

            To send email using this operation, your call must meet the following requirements:

            - The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the [CreateTemplate]() operation.
            - The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
            - If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see [Verifying Email Addresses and Domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*
            - The maximum message size is 10 MB.
            - Calls to the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation may only include one `Destination` parameter. A destination is a set of recipients that receives the same version of the email. The `Destination` parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.
            - The `Destination` parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format *UserName@\[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), the entire message is rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.

            If your call to the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message stating that it was unable to send the email.

            For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur.

If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in [Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html). For more information about Punycode, see [RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492).
            source-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the `Source` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from `user@example.com`, then you would specify the `SourceArn` to be `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`, and the `Source` to be `user@example.com`.

                For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html).
            tags: A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an email that you send using `SendTemplatedEmail`. Tags correspond to characteristics of the email that you define, so that you can publish email sending events.
            template: The template to use when sending this email.
            template-arn: The ARN of the template to use when sending this email.
            template-data: A list of replacement values to apply to the template. This parameter is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.

            - The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using [CreateTemplate]().
            - The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
            - If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may send only to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator.

            default-template-data: |-
                A list of replacement values to apply to the template when replacement data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act as a default or fallback option when no other data is available.

                The template data is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.
            destinations: One or more `Destination` objects. All of the recipients in a `Destination` receive the same version of the email. You can specify up to 50 `Destination` objects within a `Destinations` array.

            reply-to-addresses: The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies to the message, each reply-to address receives the reply.
            return-path: The email address that bounces and complaints are forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message is returned from the recipient's ISP; this message is forwarded to the email address specified by the `ReturnPath` parameter. The `ReturnPath` parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.
            return-path-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the `ReturnPath` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use `feedback@example.com`, then you would specify the `ReturnPathArn` to be `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`, and the `ReturnPath` to be `feedback@example.com`.

                For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html).
            source: |-
                The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html).

                If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the `SourceArn` parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html).

                Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in [RFC6531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531). For this reason, the email address string must be 7-bit ASCII. If you want to send to or from email addresses that contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted in the local part of the email address (the part before the @ sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in [Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html). For more information about Punycode, see [RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492).
            source-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the `Source` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from `user@example.com`, then you would specify the `SourceArn` to be `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`, and the `Source` to be `user@example.com`.

            Returns the current status of Easy DKIM signing for an entity. For domain name identities, this operation also returns the DKIM tokens that are required for Easy DKIM signing, and whether Amazon SES has successfully verified that these tokens have been published.

            This operation takes a list of identities as input and returns the following information for each:

            - Whether Easy DKIM signing is enabled or disabled.
            - A set of DKIM tokens that represent the identity. If the identity is an email address, the tokens represent the domain of that address.
            - Whether Amazon SES has successfully verified the DKIM tokens published in the domain's DNS. This information is only returned for domain name identities, not for email addresses.

            This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get DKIM attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

            For more information about creating DNS records using DKIM tokens, go to the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy-managing.html).

            Given a list of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns the verification status and (for domain identities) the verification token for each identity.

            The verification status of an email address is "Pending" until the email address owner clicks the link within the verification email that Amazon SES sent to that address. If the email address owner clicks the link within 24 hours, the verification status of the email address changes to "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, to verify the email address, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.

            For domain identities, the domain's verification status is "Pending" as Amazon SES searches for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of the domain. When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain's verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, to verify the domain, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.

            This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get verification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

      documentation:
        command: "Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.\n\nThis operation is more flexible than the `SendEmail` operation. When you use the `SendRawEmail` operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you need to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments.\n\nThe `SendRawEmail` operation has the following requirements:\n\n- You can only send email from [verified email addresses or domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html). If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation results in an \"Email address not verified\" error.\n- If your account is still in the [Amazon SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html), you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the [Amazon SES mailbox simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-an-email-from-console.html).\n- The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.\n- Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.\n- If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in the format *UserName@\\[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.\n- Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.\n- Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see [MIME Encoding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide*.\n\nAdditionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the `SendRawEmail` operation:\n\n- Although you can customize the message headers when using the `SendRawEmail` operation, Amazon SES automatically applies its own `Message-ID` and `Date` headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they are overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.\n- If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, `SendRawEmail` enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters `SourceArn`, `FromArn`, and/or `ReturnPathArn`, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:\n  \n  - `X-SES-SOURCE-ARN`\n  - `X-SES-FROM-ARN`\n  - `X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN`\n  \n  Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.\n  \n  If you only specify the `SourceIdentityArn` parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.\n  \n  For more information about sending authorization, see the [Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*\n- For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your *sending quota*). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see [Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/manage-sending-quotas.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*"

            from-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to specify a particular "From" address in the header of the raw email.

                Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header `X-SES-FROM-ARN` in the raw message of the email. If you use both the `FromArn` parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses the value of the `FromArn` parameter.

                For information about when to use this parameter, see the description of `SendRawEmail` in this guide, or see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization-delegate-sender-tasks-email.html).
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            raw-message: |-
                The raw email message itself. The message has to meet the following criteria:

                - The message has to contain a header and a body, separated by a blank line.
                - All of the required header fields must be present in the message.
                - Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly.
                - Attachments must be of a content type that Amazon SES supports. For a list on unsupported content types, see [Unsupported Attachment Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/mime-types.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide*.
                - The entire message must be base64-encoded.
                - If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend that you encode that content. For more information, see [Sending Raw Email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html) in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide*.
                - Per [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3.1.6), the maximum length of each line of text, including the &lt;CRLF&gt;, must not exceed 1,000 characters.
            return-path-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the `ReturnPath` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use `feedback@example.com`, then you would specify the `ReturnPathArn` to be `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`, and the `ReturnPath` to be `feedback@example.com`.

                Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header `X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN` in the raw message of the email. If you use both the `ReturnPathArn` parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses the value of the `ReturnPathArn` parameter.

                For information about when to use this parameter, see the description of `SendRawEmail` in this guide, or see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization-delegate-sender-tasks-email.html).
            source: |-
                The identity's email address. If you do not provide a value for this parameter, you must specify a "From" address in the raw text of the message. (You can also specify both.)

                Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in[RFC6531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531). For this reason, the email address string must be 7-bit ASCII. If you want to send to or from email addresses that contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted in the local part of the email address (the part before the @ sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in [Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html). For more information about Punycode, see [RFC 3492](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492).

                If you specify the `Source` parameter and have feedback forwarding enabled, then bounces and complaints are sent to this email address. This takes precedence over any Return-Path header that you might include in the raw text of the message.
            source-arn: |-
                This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the `Source` parameter.

                For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from `user@example.com`, then you would specify the `SourceArn` to be `arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`, and the `Source` to be `user@example.com`.

                Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header `X-SES-SOURCE-ARN` in the raw message of the email. If you use both the `SourceArn` parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses the value of the `SourceArn` parameter.

                For information about when to use this parameter, see the description of `SendRawEmail` in this guide, or see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization-delegate-sender-tasks-email.html).

            It's recommended that for successive pagination calls of this API, you continue to the use the same parameter/value pairs as used in the original call, e.g., if you used `IdentityType=Domain` in the the original call and received a `NextToken` in the response, you should continue providing the `IdentityType=Domain` parameter for further `NextToken` calls; however, if you didn't provide the `IdentityType` parameter in the original call, then continue to not provide it for successive pagination calls. Using this protocol will ensure consistent results.

            Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.

            When you execute the `VerifyDomainDkim` operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated the domain with your account by using the `VerifyDomainIdentity` operation. However, you can't send email from the domain until you either successfully [verify it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html#verify-domain-procedure) or you successfully [set up DKIM for it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy.html).

            You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM.

            To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values:

            - **Name**: *token*.\_domainkey.*example.com*
            - **Type**: CNAME
            - **Value**: *token*.dkim.amazonses.com

            In the preceding example, replace *token* with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace *example.com* with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this operation.

            You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

                Given a list of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns the verification status and (for domain identities) the verification token for each identity.

                The verification status of an email address is "Pending" until the email address owner clicks the link within the verification email that Amazon SES sent to that address. If the email address owner clicks the link within 24 hours, the verification status of the email address changes to "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, to verify the email address, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.

                For domain identities, the domain's verification status is "Pending" as Amazon SES searches for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of the domain. When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain's verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, to verify the domain, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.

                This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get verification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.
