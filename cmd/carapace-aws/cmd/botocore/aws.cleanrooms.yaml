                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results that are returned for an API request call. The service chooses a default number if you don't set one. The service might return a \`nextToken\` even if the \`maxResults\` value has not been met.
            next-token: The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

        Welcome to the *Clean Rooms API Reference*.

        Clean Rooms is an Amazon Web Services service that helps multiple parties to join their data together in a secure collaboration workspace. In the collaboration, members who can run queries and jobs and receive results can get insights into the collective datasets without either party getting access to the other party's raw data.

        To learn more about Clean Rooms concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the [Clean Rooms User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

        To learn more about SQL commands, functions, and conditions supported in Clean Rooms, see the [Clean Rooms SQL Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/sql-reference/sql-reference.html).
