      documentation:
        command: |-
            Used by activity workers to report to the service that the [ActivityTask]() represented by the specified `taskToken` is still making progress. The worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent complete, using the `details` parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the boolean `cancelRequested` flag returned by the service is set to `true`.

            This action resets the `taskHeartbeatTimeout` clock. The `taskHeartbeatTimeout` is specified in [RegisterActivityType]().

            This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history contains a `ActivityTaskTimedOut` event that contains the information from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.

            The `taskStartToCloseTimeout` of an activity type is the maximum duration of an activity task, regardless of the number of [RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat]() requests received. The `taskStartToCloseTimeout` is also specified in [RegisterActivityType]().

            This operation is only useful for long-lived activities to report liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being attempted.

            If the `cancelRequested` flag returns `true`, a cancellation is being attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with [RespondActivityTaskCanceled](). Otherwise, it should ignore the cancellation request.

            **Access Control**

            You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

            - Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
            - Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
            - You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

            If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`.

                - `REQUEST_CANCEL` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
                - `ABANDON` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

                A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

            Used by workers to get an [ActivityTask]() from the specified activity `taskList`. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available. The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns an empty result. An empty result, in this context, means that an ActivityTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string. If a task is returned, the worker should use its type to identify and process it correctly.

            Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 70 seconds (10 seconds higher than the maximum time service may hold the poll request).

            **Access Control**

            - Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
            - Constrain the `taskList.name` parameter by using a `Condition` element with the `swf:taskList.name` key to allow the action to access only certain task lists.

            If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`.

            **Access Control**

            You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

            - Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. The element must be set to `arn:aws:swf::AccountID:domain/*`, where *AccountID* is the account ID, with no dashes.
            - Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
            - You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

            If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the [StartWorkflowExecution]() action or the `StartChildWorkflowExecution` [Decision]().

                The supported child policies are:

                - `TERMINATE` – The child executions are terminated.
                - `REQUEST_CANCEL` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

            A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to [RespondActivityTaskCompleted](), RespondActivityTaskCanceled, [RespondActivityTaskFailed](), or the task has [timed out](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html#swf-dev-timeout-types).

            child-policy: |-
                If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of this workflow execution if it is terminated, by calling the [TerminateWorkflowExecution]() action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This policy overrides the default child policy specified when registering the workflow type using [RegisterWorkflowType]().

                The supported child policies are:

                - `TERMINATE` – The child executions are terminated.
                - `REQUEST_CANCEL` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
                - `ABANDON` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

                A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

            domain: |-
                The name of the domain in which the workflow execution is created.

                The specified string must not contain a `:` (colon), `/` (slash), `|` (vertical bar), or any control characters (`\u0000-\u001f` | `\u007f-\u009f`). Also, it must *not* be the literal string `arn`.
            execution-start-to-close-timeout: |-
                The total duration for this workflow execution. This overrides the defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout specified when registering the workflow type.

                The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to `0`. Exceeding this limit causes the workflow execution to time out. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of "NONE" for this timeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run.

                An execution start-to-close timeout must be specified either through this parameter or as a default when the workflow type is registered. If neither this parameter nor a default execution start-to-close timeout is specified, a fault is returned.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            input: The input for the workflow execution. This is a free form string which should be meaningful to the workflow you are starting. This `input` is made available to the new workflow execution in the `WorkflowExecutionStarted` history event.
            lambda-role: |-
                The IAM role to attach to this workflow execution.

                Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don't attach an IAM role, any attempt to schedule a Lambda task fails. This results in a `ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed` history event. For more information, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
            tag-list: The list of tags to associate with the workflow execution. You can specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can list workflow executions with a specific tag by calling [ListOpenWorkflowExecutions]() or [ListClosedWorkflowExecutions]() and specifying a [TagFilter]().
            task-list: |-
                The task list to use for the decision tasks generated for this workflow execution. This overrides the `defaultTaskList` specified when registering the workflow type.

                A task list for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default task list was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

                The specified string must not contain a `:` (colon), `/` (slash), `|` (vertical bar), or any control characters (`\u0000-\u001f` | `\u007f-\u009f`). Also, it must *not* be the literal string `arn`.
            task-priority: |-
                The task priority to use for this workflow execution. This overrides any default priority that was assigned when the workflow type was registered. If not set, then the default task priority for the workflow type is used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (-2147483648) to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

                For more information about setting task priority, see [Setting Task Priority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/programming-priority.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
            task-start-to-close-timeout: |-
                Specifies the maximum duration of decision tasks for this workflow execution. This parameter overrides the `defaultTaskStartToCloseTimout` specified when registering the workflow type using [RegisterWorkflowType]().

                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to `0`. You can use `NONE` to specify unlimited duration.

                A task start-to-close timeout for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default task start-to-close timeout was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.
            workflow-id: |-
                The user defined identifier associated with the workflow execution. You can use this to associate a custom identifier with the workflow execution. You may specify the same identifier if a workflow execution is logically a *restart* of a previous execution. You cannot have two open workflow executions with the same `workflowId` at the same time within the same domain.

                The specified string must not contain a `:` (colon), `/` (slash), `|` (vertical bar), or any control characters (`\u0000-\u001f` | `\u007f-\u009f`). Also, it must *not* be the literal string `arn`.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            maximum-page-size: The maximum number of results that are returned per call. Use `nextPageToken` to obtain further pages of results.
            next-page-token: |-
                If `NextPageToken` is returned there are more results available. The value of `NextPageToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return a `400` error: "`Specified token has exceeded its maximum lifetime`".

                The configured `maximumPageSize` determines how many results can be returned in a single call.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            reverse-order: When set to `true`, returns the events in reverse order. By default the results are returned in ascending order of the `eventTimeStamp` of the events.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            Used by workers to tell the service that the [ActivityTask]() identified by the `taskToken` completed successfully with a `result` (if provided). The `result` appears in the `ActivityTaskCompleted` event in the workflow history.

            If the requested task doesn't complete successfully, use [RespondActivityTaskFailed]() instead. If the worker finds that the task is canceled through the `canceled` flag returned by [RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat](), it should cancel the task, clean up and then call [RespondActivityTaskCanceled]().

            A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to RespondActivityTaskCompleted, [RespondActivityTaskCanceled](), [RespondActivityTaskFailed](), or the task has [timed out](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html#swf-dev-timeout-types).

            **Access Control**

            You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

            - Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
            - Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
            - You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

            If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

            Used by deciders to get a [DecisionTask]() from the specified decision `taskList`. A decision task may be returned for any open workflow execution that is using the specified task list. The task includes a paginated view of the history of the workflow execution. The decider should use the workflow type and the history to determine how to properly handle the task.

            This action initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon a task becomes available. If no decision task is available in the specified task list before the timeout of 60 seconds expires, an empty result is returned. An empty result, in this context, means that a DecisionTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string.

            Deciders should set their client side socket timeout to at least 70 seconds (10 seconds higher than the timeout).

            Because the number of workflow history events for a single workflow execution might be very large, the result returned might be split up across a number of pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make additional calls to `PollForDecisionTask` using the `nextPageToken` returned by the initial call. Note that you do *not* call `GetWorkflowExecutionHistory` with this `nextPageToken`. Instead, call `PollForDecisionTask` again.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            domain: The name of the domain containing the task lists to poll.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            identity: Identity of the decider making the request, which is recorded in the DecisionTaskStarted event in the workflow history. This enables diagnostic tracing when problems arise. The form of this identity is user defined.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            maximum-page-size: |-
                The maximum number of results that are returned per call. Use `nextPageToken` to obtain further pages of results.

                This is an upper limit only; the actual number of results returned per call may be fewer than the specified maximum.
            next-page-token: |-
                If `NextPageToken` is returned there are more results available. The value of `NextPageToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return a `400` error: "`Specified token has exceeded its maximum lifetime`".

                The configured `maximumPageSize` determines how many results can be returned in a single call.

                The `nextPageToken` returned by this action cannot be used with [GetWorkflowExecutionHistory]() to get the next page. You must call [PollForDecisionTask]() again (with the `nextPageToken`) to retrieve the next page of history records. Calling [PollForDecisionTask]() with a `nextPageToken` doesn't return a new decision task.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            reverse-order: When set to `true`, returns the events in reverse order. By default the results are returned in ascending order of the `eventTimestamp` of the events.
            start-at-previous-started-event: When set to `true`, returns the events with `eventTimestamp` greater than or equal to `eventTimestamp` of the most recent `DecisionTaskStarted` event. By default, this parameter is set to `false`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            task-list: |-
                Specifies the task list to poll for decision tasks.

                The specified string must not contain a `:` (colon), `/` (slash), `|` (vertical bar), or any control characters (`\u0000-\u001f` | `\u007f-\u009f`). Also, it must *not* be the literal string `arn`.

            Records a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in the currently running workflow execution identified by the given domain, workflowId, and runId. This logically requests the cancellation of the workflow execution as a whole. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

            If the runId isn't specified, the `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow execution with the specified workflowId in the domain.

            Because this action allows the workflow to properly clean up and gracefully close, it should be used instead of [TerminateWorkflowExecution]() when possible.

            **Access Control**

            You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

            - Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
            - Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
            - You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

            If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails.

        Amazon Simple Workflow Service

        The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a *task* represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.

        Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.

        This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the [*Amazon SWF Developer Guide*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/) .
