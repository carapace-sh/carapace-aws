                A query to filter users by user name. Remember the following about the `Userids` and `Query` parameters:

                - If you don't use either parameter, the API returns a paginated list of all users on the site.
                - If you use both parameters, the API ignores the `Query` parameter.
                - The `Userid` parameter only returns user names that match a corresponding user ID.
                - The `Query` parameter runs a "prefix" search for users by the `GivenName`, `SurName`, or `UserName` fields included in a [CreateUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateUser.html) API call. For example, querying on `Ma` returns Márcia Oliveira, María García, and Mateo Jackson. If you use multiple characters, the API only returns data that matches all characters. For example, querying on `Ma J` only returns Mateo Jackson.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
