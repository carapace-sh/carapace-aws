            Links an existing user account in a user pool, or `DestinationUser`, to an identity from an external IdP, or `SourceUser`, based on a specified attribute name and value from the external IdP.

            This operation connects a local user profile with a user identity who hasn't yet signed in from their third-party IdP. When the user signs in with their IdP, they get access-control configuration from the local user profile. Linked local users can also sign in with SDK-based API operations like `InitiateAuth` after they sign in at least once through their IdP. For more information, see [Linking federated users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html).

            The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is five.

            Because this API allows a user with an external federated identity to sign in as a local user, it is critical that it only be used with external IdPs and linked attributes that you trust.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

            destination-user: |-
                The existing user in the user pool that you want to assign to the external IdP user account. This user can be a local (Username + Password) Amazon Cognito user pools user or a federated user (for example, a SAML or Facebook user). If the user doesn't exist, Amazon Cognito generates an exception. Amazon Cognito returns this user when the new user (with the linked IdP attribute) signs in.

                For a native username + password user, the `ProviderAttributeValue` for the `DestinationUser` should be the username in the user pool. For a federated user, it should be the provider-specific `user_id`.

                The `ProviderAttributeName` of the `DestinationUser` is ignored.

                The `ProviderName` should be set to `Cognito` for users in Cognito user pools.

                All attributes in the DestinationUser profile must be mutable. If you have assigned the user any immutable custom attributes, the operation won't succeed.

            source-user: |-
                An external IdP account for a user who doesn't exist yet in the user pool. This user must be a federated user (for example, a SAML or Facebook user), not another native user.

                If the `SourceUser` is using a federated social IdP, such as Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon, you must set the `ProviderAttributeName` to `Cognito_Subject`. For social IdPs, the `ProviderName` will be `Facebook`, `Google`, or `LoginWithAmazon`, and Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the Facebook, Google, and Login with Amazon tokens for `id`, `sub`, and `user_id`, respectively. The `ProviderAttributeValue` for the user must be the same value as the `id`, `sub`, or `user_id` value found in the social IdP token.

                For OIDC, the `ProviderAttributeName` can be any mapped value from a claim in the ID token, or that your app retrieves from the `userInfo` endpoint. For SAML, the `ProviderAttributeName` can be any mapped value from a claim in the SAML assertion.

                The following additional considerations apply to `SourceUser` for OIDC and SAML providers.

                - You must map the claim to a user pool attribute in your IdP configuration, and set the user pool attribute name as the value of `ProviderAttributeName` in your `AdminLinkProviderForUser` request. For example, `email`.
                - When you set `ProviderAttributeName` to `Cognito_Subject`, Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the default unique identifier found in the subject from the IdP token.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *custom message* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminUpdateUserAttributes request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            user-attributes: |-
                An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes.

                For custom attributes, you must prepend the `custom:` prefix to the attribute name.

                If your user pool requires verification before Amazon Cognito updates an attribute value that you specify in this request, Amazon Cognito doesn’t immediately update the value of that attribute. After your user receives and responds to a verification message to verify the new value, Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value. Your user can sign in and receive messages with the original attribute value until they verify the new value.

                To skip the verification message and update the value of an attribute that requires verification in the same API request, include the `email_verified` or `phone_number_verified` attribute, with a value of `true`. If you set the `email_verified` or `phone_number_verified` value for an `email` or `phone_number` attribute that requires verification to `true`, Amazon Cognito doesn’t send a verification message to your user.
            user-pool-id: The ID of the user pool where you want to update user attributes.
            username: The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be any of their alias attributes. If `username` isn't an alias attribute in your user pool, this value must be the `sub` of a local user or the username of a user from a third-party IdP.

            Modifies existing terms documents for the requested app client. When Terms and conditions and Privacy policy documents are configured, the app client displays links to them in the sign-up page of managed login for the app client.

Amazon Cognito directs users to the terms documents for their current language, with fallback to `default` if no document exists for the language.

            Each request accepts one type of terms document and a map of language-to-link for that document type. You must provide both types of terms documents in at least one language before Amazon Cognito displays your terms documents. Supply each type in separate requests.

            For more information, see [Terms documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html#managed-login-terms-documents).

This operation creates a new user pool prefix domain or custom domain and sets the managed login branding version. Set the branding version to `1` for hosted UI (classic) or `2` for managed login. When you choose a custom domain, you must provide an SSL certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region in your request.

            Your prefix domain might take up to one minute to take effect. Your custom domain is online within five minutes, but it can take up to one hour to distribute your SSL certificate.

If you had a prefix domain active, this will cause passkey integration for your prefix domain to stop working due to a mismatch in RP ID. To keep the prefix domain passkey integration working, you can explicitly set RP ID to the prefix domain.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the `GetTokensFromRefreshToken` API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the Lambda function the pre token generation trigger.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.

                When you enable device remembering, Amazon Cognito issues a device key that you can use for device authentication that bypasses multi-factor authentication (MFA). To implement `GetTokensFromRefreshToken` in a user pool with device remembering, you must capture the device key from the initial authentication request. If your application doesn't provide the key of a registered device, Amazon Cognito issues a new one. You must provide the confirmed device key in this request if device remembering is enabled in your user pool.

For this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html).

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *custom message* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminCreateUser API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *pre sign-up* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `ClientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminCreateUser request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.
            desired-delivery-mediums: Specify `EMAIL` if email will be used to send the welcome message. Specify `SMS` if the phone number will be used. The default value is `SMS`. You can specify more than one value.
            force-alias-creation: |-
                This parameter is used only if the `phone_number_verified` or `email_verified` attribute is set to `True`. Otherwise, it is ignored.

                If this parameter is set to `True` and the phone number or email address specified in the `UserAttributes` parameter already exists as an alias with a different user, this request migrates the alias from the previous user to the newly-created user. The previous user will no longer be able to log in using that alias.

                If this parameter is set to `False`, the API throws an `AliasExistsException` error if the alias already exists. The default value is `False`.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            message-action: Set to `RESEND` to resend the invitation message to a user that already exists, and to reset the temporary-password duration with a new temporary password. Set to `SUPPRESS` to suppress sending the message. You can specify only one value.
            temporary-password: |-
                The user's temporary password. This password must conform to the password policy that you specified when you created the user pool.

                The exception to the requirement for a password is when your user pool supports passwordless sign-in with email or SMS OTPs. To create a user with no password, omit this parameter or submit a blank value. You can only create a passwordless user when passwordless sign-in is available.

                The temporary password is valid only once. To complete the Admin Create User flow, the user must enter the temporary password in the sign-in page, along with a new password to be used in all future sign-ins.

                If you don't specify a value, Amazon Cognito generates one for you unless you have passwordless options active for your user pool.

                The temporary password can only be used until the user account expiration limit that you set for your user pool. To reset the account after that time limit, you must call `AdminCreateUser` again and specify `RESEND` for the `MessageAction` parameter.
            user-attributes: |-
                An array of name-value pairs that contain user attributes and attribute values to be set for the user to be created. You can create a user without specifying any attributes other than `Username`. However, any attributes that you specify as required (when creating a user pool or in the **Attributes** tab of the console) either you should supply (in your call to `AdminCreateUser`) or the user should supply (when they sign up in response to your welcome message).

                For custom attributes, you must prepend the `custom:` prefix to the attribute name.

                To send a message inviting the user to sign up, you must specify the user's email address or phone number. You can do this in your call to AdminCreateUser or in the **Users** tab of the Amazon Cognito console for managing your user pools.

                You must also provide an email address or phone number when you expect the user to do passwordless sign-in with an email or SMS OTP. These attributes must be provided when passwordless options are the only available, or when you don't submit a `TemporaryPassword`.

                In your `AdminCreateUser` request, you can set the `email_verified` and `phone_number_verified` attributes to `true`. The following conditions apply:

                email

                The email address where you want the user to receive their confirmation code and username. You must provide a value for `email` when you want to set `email_verified` to `true`, or if you set `EMAIL` in the `DesiredDeliveryMediums` parameter.

                phone\_number

                The phone number where you want the user to receive their confirmation code and username. You must provide a value for `phone_number` when you want to set `phone_number_verified` to `true`, or if you set `SMS` in the `DesiredDeliveryMediums` parameter.
            user-pool-id: The ID of the user pool where you want to create a user.
            username: |-
                The value that you want to set as the username sign-in attribute. The following conditions apply to the username parameter.

                - The username can't be a duplicate of another username in the same user pool.
                - You can't change the value of a username after you create it.
                - You can only provide a value if usernames are a valid sign-in attribute for your user pool. If your user pool only supports phone numbers or email addresses as sign-in attributes, Amazon Cognito automatically generates a username value. For more information, see [Customizing sign-in attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases).
            validation-data: |-
                Temporary user attributes that contribute to the outcomes of your pre sign-up Lambda trigger. This set of key-value pairs are for custom validation of information that you collect from your users but don't need to retain.

                Your Lambda function can analyze this additional data and act on it. Your function can automatically confirm and verify select users or perform external API operations like logging user attributes and validation data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                For more information about the pre sign-up Lambda trigger, see [Pre sign-up Lambda trigger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-sign-up.html).

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the ForgotPassword API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: *pre sign-up*, *custom message*, and *user migration*. When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ForgotPassword request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.

            Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html).

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production.

                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action initiates.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the UpdateUserAttributes API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *custom message* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your UpdateUserAttributes request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

                If you have set an attribute to require verification before Amazon Cognito updates its value, this request doesn’t immediately update the value of that attribute. After your user receives and responds to a verification message to verify the new value, Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value. Your user can sign in and receive messages with the original attribute value until they verify the new value.

            Given a user pool app client ID, updates the configuration. To avoid setting parameters to Amazon Cognito defaults, construct this API request to pass the existing configuration of your app client, modified to include the changes that you want to make.

            If you don't provide a value for an attribute, Amazon Cognito sets it to its default value.

            Unlike app clients created in the console, Amazon Cognito doesn't automatically assign a branding style to app clients that you configure with this API operation. Managed login and classic hosted UI pages aren't available for your client until after you apply a branding style.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

        flag:
            access-token-validity: |-
                The access token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their access token. To specify the time unit for `AccessTokenValidity` as `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`, set a `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.

                For example, when you set `AccessTokenValidity` to `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` to `hours`, your user can authorize access with their access token for 10 hours.

                The default time unit for `AccessTokenValidity` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

                If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your access tokens are valid for one hour.
            allowed-o-auth-flows: |-
                The OAuth grant types that you want your app client to generate. To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add `client_credentials` as the only allowed OAuth flow.

                code

                Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the `/oauth2/token` endpoint.

                implicit

                Issue the access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly to your user.

                client\_credentials

                Issue the access token from the `/oauth2/token` endpoint directly to a non-person user using a combination of the client ID and client secret.
            allowed-o-auth-flows-user-pool-client: |-
                Set to `true` to use OAuth 2.0 authorization server features in your app client.

                This parameter must have a value of `true` before you can configure the following features in your app client.

                - `CallBackURLs`: Callback URLs.
                - `LogoutURLs`: Sign-out redirect URLs.
                - `AllowedOAuthScopes`: OAuth 2.0 scopes.
                - `AllowedOAuthFlows`: Support for authorization code, implicit, and client credentials OAuth 2.0 grants.

                To use authorization server features, configure one of these features in the Amazon Cognito console or set `AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient` to `true` in a `CreateUserPoolClient` or `UpdateUserPoolClient` API request. If you don't set a value for `AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient` in a request with the CLI or SDKs, it defaults to `false`. When `false`, only SDK-based API sign-in is permitted.
            allowed-o-auth-scopes: The OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and custom scopes that you want to permit your app client to authorize access with. Scopes govern access control to user pool self-service API operations, user data from the `userInfo` endpoint, and third-party APIs. Scope values include `phone`, `email`, `openid`, and `profile`. The `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin` scope authorizes user self-service operations. Custom scopes with resource servers authorize access to external APIs.
            analytics-configuration: |-
                The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign.

                In Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools might not have access to analytics or might be configurable with campaigns in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. For more information, see [Using Amazon Pinpoint analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.html).
            auth-session-validity: Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. `AuthSessionValidity` is the duration, in minutes, of that session token. Your user pool native user must respond to each authentication challenge before the session expires.
            callback-urls: |-
                A list of allowed redirect, or callback, URLs for managed login authentication. These URLs are the paths where you want to send your users' browsers after they complete authentication with managed login or a third-party IdP. Typically, callback URLs are the home of an application that uses OAuth or OIDC libraries to process authentication outcomes.

                A redirect URI must meet the following requirements:

                - Be an absolute URI.
                - Be registered with the authorization server. Amazon Cognito doesn't accept authorization requests with `redirect_uri` values that aren't in the list of `CallbackURLs` that you provide in this parameter.
                - Not include a fragment component.

                See [OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2).

                Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only.

                App callback URLs such as `myapp://example` are also supported.

            enable-propagate-additional-user-context-data: When `true`, your application can include additional `UserContextData` in authentication requests. This data includes the IP address, and contributes to analysis by threat protection features. For more information about propagation of user context data, see [Adding session data to API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint). If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send the source IP address to Amazon Cognito threat protection features. You can only activate `EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData` in an app client that has a client secret.

For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions.\n\nIf you don't specify a value for `ExplicitAuthFlows`, your app client supports `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`, `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`, and `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`.\n\nThe values for authentication flow options include the following.\n\n- `ALLOW_USER_AUTH`: Enable selection-based sign-in with `USER_AUTH`. This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other `ExplicitAuthFlows` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through `USER_AUTH` without the flow `USER_SRP_AUTH` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include `CUSTOM_AUTH`.\n  \n  To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the [Essentials tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html) or higher.\n- `ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`: Enable admin based user password authentication flow `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`. This setting replaces the `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.\n- `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.\n- `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.\n- `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`: Enable SRP-based authentication.\n- `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`: Enable authflow to refresh tokens.\n\nIn some environments, you will see the values `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`, `CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY`, or `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`. You can't assign these legacy `ExplicitAuthFlows` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with `ALLOW_`, like `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`."

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            id-token-validity: |-
                The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their ID token. To specify the time unit for `IdTokenValidity` as `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`, set a `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.

                For example, when you set `IdTokenValidity` as `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` as `hours`, your user can authenticate their session with their ID token for 10 hours.

                The default time unit for `IdTokenValidity` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

                If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your ID tokens are valid for one hour.
            logout-urls: A list of allowed logout URLs for managed login authentication. When you pass `logout_uri` and `client_id` parameters to `/logout`, Amazon Cognito signs out your user and redirects them to the logout URL. This parameter describes the URLs that you want to be the permitted targets of `logout_uri`. A typical use of these URLs is when a user selects "Sign out" and you redirect them to your public homepage. For more information, see [Logout endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html).
            prevent-user-existence-errors: |-
                When `ENABLED`, suppresses messages that might indicate a valid user exists when someone attempts sign-in. This parameters sets your preference for the errors and responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to `ENABLED` and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to `LEGACY`, those APIs return a `UserNotFoundException` exception if the user doesn't exist in the user pool.

                Defaults to `LEGACY`.
            read-attributes: |-
                The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

                When you don't specify the `ReadAttributes` for your app client, your app can read the values of `email_verified`, `phone_number_verified`, and the standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool app client has read access to these default attributes, `ReadAttributes` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates `ReadAttributes` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.
            refresh-token-rotation: The configuration of your app client for refresh token rotation. When enabled, your app client issues new ID, access, and refresh tokens when users renew their sessions with refresh tokens. When disabled, token refresh issues only ID and access tokens.
            refresh-token-validity: |-
                The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their refresh token. To specify the time unit for `RefreshTokenValidity` as `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`, set a `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.

                For example, when you set `RefreshTokenValidity` as `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` as `days`, your user can refresh their session and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days.

                The default time unit for `RefreshTokenValidity` in an API request is days. You can't set `RefreshTokenValidity` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default value of 30 days. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

                If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.
            supported-identity-providers: |-
                A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: `COGNITO`, `Facebook`, `Google`, `SignInWithApple`, and `LoginWithAmazon`. You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example `MySAMLIdP` or `MyOIDCIdP`.

                This parameter sets the IdPs that [managed login](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html) will display on the login page for your app client. The removal of `COGNITO` from this list doesn't prevent authentication operations for local users with the user pools API in an Amazon Web Services SDK. The only way to prevent SDK-based authentication is to block access with a [WAF rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-waf.html).
            token-validity-units: The units that validity times are represented in. The default unit for refresh tokens is days, and the default for ID and access tokens are hours.
            user-pool-id: The ID of the user pool where you want to update the app client.
            write-attributes: |-
                The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

                When you don't specify the `WriteAttributes` for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, `WriteAttributes` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates `WriteAttributes` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes.

                If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see [Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html).

        command: |-
            A user pool domain hosts managed login, an authorization server and web server for authentication in your application. This operation updates the branding version for user pool domains between `1` for hosted UI (classic) and `2` for managed login. It also updates the SSL certificate for user pool custom domains.

            Changes to the domain branding version take up to one minute to take effect for a prefix domain and up to five minutes for a custom domain.

            This operation doesn't change the name of your user pool domain. To change your domain, delete it with `DeleteUserPoolDomain` and create a new domain with `CreateUserPoolDomain`.

            You can pass the ARN of a new Certificate Manager certificate in this request. Typically, ACM certificates automatically renew and you user pool can continue to use the same ARN. But if you generate a new certificate for your custom domain name, replace the original configuration with the new ARN in this request.

            ACM certificates for custom domains must be in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain.

            For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see [Configuring a user pool domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain.html).

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

                Mutable

                If true, you can grant app clients write access to the attribute value. If false, the attribute value can only be set up on sign-up or administrator creation of users.

                Name

                The attribute name. For an attribute like `custom:myAttribute`, enter `myAttribute` for this field.

                Required

                When true, users who sign up or are created must set a value for the attribute.

            Prevents the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or social) identity provider (IdP). If the user that you want to deactivate is a Amazon Cognito user pools native username + password user, they can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is no longer attached to the previously linked `DestinationUser`, the user must create a new user account.

            The value of `ProviderName` must match the name of a user pool IdP.

            To deactivate a local user, set `ProviderName` to `Cognito` and the `ProviderAttributeName` to `Cognito_Subject`. The `ProviderAttributeValue` must be user's local username.

            The `ProviderAttributeName` must always be `Cognito_Subject` for social IdPs. The `ProviderAttributeValue` must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user.

            For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign in, the `ProviderAttributeName` and `ProviderAttributeValue` must be the same values that were used for the `SourceUser` when the identities were originally linked using `AdminLinkProviderForUser` call. This is also true if the linking was done with `ProviderAttributeName` set to `Cognito_Subject`. If the user has already signed in, the `ProviderAttributeName` must be `Cognito_Subject` and `ProviderAttributeValue` must be the `NameID` from their SAML assertion.

When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. In this payload, the `clientMetadata` attribute provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminConfirmSignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the ClientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.

            Assigns a set of tags to an Amazon Cognito user pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

            Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of a user pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an `Environment` tag key to both user pools. The value of this key might be `Test` for one user pool, and `Production` for the other.

            Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your user pools. In an Identity and Access Management policy, you can constrain permissions for user pools based on specific tags or tag values.

            You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account. A user pool can have as many as 50 tags.

                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of authentication events to return. Returns 60 events if you set `MaxResults` to 0, or if you don't include a `MaxResults` parameter.
            next-token: This API operation returns a limited number of results. The pagination token is an identifier that you can present in an additional API request with the same parameters. When you include the pagination token, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items after the current list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token. By use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the ConfirmForgotPassword API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *post confirmation* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ConfirmForgotPassword request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

                - *AttributeName*: The name of the attribute to search for. You can only search for one attribute at a time.
                - *Filter-Type*: For an exact match, use `=`, for example, "`given_name = \"Jon\"`". For a prefix ("starts with") match, use `^=`, for example, "`given_name ^= \"Jon\"`".

                If the filter string is empty, `ListUsers` returns all users in the user pool.

                You can only search for the following standard attributes:

                - `username` (case-sensitive)
                - `email`

                - `status (called Enabled in the Console) (case-sensitive)`
                - `sub`

                Custom attributes aren't searchable.

                You can also list users with a client-side filter. The server-side filter matches no more than one attribute. For an advanced search, use a client-side filter with the `--query` parameter of the `list-users` action in the CLI. When you use a client-side filter, ListUsers returns a paginated list of zero or more users. You can receive multiple pages in a row with zero results. Repeat the query with each pagination token that is returned until you receive a null pagination token value, and then review the combined result.

                For more information about server-side and client-side filtering, see [FilteringCLI output](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-filter.html) in the [Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-filter.html).

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

            You might receive a `LimitExceeded` exception in response to this request if you have exceeded a rate quota for email or SMS messages, and if your user pool automatically verifies email addresses or phone numbers. When you get this exception in the response, the user is successfully created and is in an `UNCONFIRMED` state.

                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the SignUp API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: *pre sign-up*, *custom message*, and *post confirmation*. When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your SignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

                The user's proposed password. The password must comply with the [password requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/managing-users-passwords.html) of your user pool.

                Users can sign up without a password when your user pool supports passwordless sign-in with email or SMS OTPs. To create a user with no password, omit this parameter or submit a blank value. You can only create a passwordless user when passwordless sign-in is available.
            secret-hash: A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in the message.

            validation-data: |-
                Temporary user attributes that contribute to the outcomes of your pre sign-up Lambda trigger. This set of key-value pairs are for custom validation of information that you collect from your users but don't need to retain.

                Your Lambda function can analyze this additional data and act on it. Your function can automatically confirm and verify select users or perform external API operations like logging user attributes and validation data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                A non-negative integer value that specifies the precedence of this group relative to the other groups that a user can belong to in the user pool. Zero is the highest precedence value. Groups with lower `Precedence` values take precedence over groups with higher or null `Precedence` values. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN is given in the user's tokens for the `cognito:roles` and `cognito:preferred_role` claims.

                Two groups can have the same `Precedence` value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same `Precedence` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim isn't set in users' tokens.

                The default `Precedence` value is null. The maximum `Precedence` value is `2^31-1`.
            role-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that you want to associate with the group. A group role primarily declares a preferred role for the credentials that you get from an identity pool.

            Some API operations in a user pool generate a challenge, like a prompt for an MFA code, for device authentication that bypasses MFA, or for a custom authentication challenge. A `RespondToAuthChallenge` API request provides the answer to that challenge, like a code or a secure remote password (SRP). The parameters of a response to an authentication challenge vary with the type of challenge.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the RespondToAuthChallenge API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: *post authentication*, *pre token generation*, *define auth challenge*, *create auth challenge*, and *verify auth challenge*. When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your RespondToAuthChallenge request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

            session: The session identifier that maintains the state of authentication requests and challenge responses.

An `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` API request provides the answer to that challenge, like a code or a secure remote password (SRP). The parameters of a response to an authentication challenge vary with the type of challenge.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminRespondToAuthChallenge API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that you have assigned to the following triggers:

                - Pre sign-up
                - custom message
                - Post authentication
                - User migration
                - Pre token generation
                - Define auth challenge
                - Create auth challenge
                - Verify auth challenge response

                When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute that provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminRespondToAuthChallenge request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.
            context-data: |-
                Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

            session: The session identifier that maintains the state of authentication requests and challenge responses. If an `AdminInitiateAuth` or `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` API request results in a determination that your application must pass another challenge, Amazon Cognito returns a session with other challenge parameters. Send this session identifier, unmodified, to the next `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` request.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you provide a value for any `DeviceConfiguration` field, you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature. For more information, see [Working with devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html).
            email-configuration: The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region, and sender for email invitation and verification messages from your user pool.
            email-verification-message: This parameter is no longer used.
            email-verification-subject: This parameter is no longer used.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            lambda-config: A collection of user pool Lambda triggers. Amazon Cognito invokes triggers at several possible stages of authentication operations. Triggers can modify the outcome of the operations that invoked them.
            mfa-configuration: |-
                Sets multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be on, off, or optional. When `ON`, all users must set up MFA before they can sign in. When `OPTIONAL`, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose `OPTIONAL`.

                When `MfaConfiguration` is `OPTIONAL`, managed login doesn't automatically prompt users to set up MFA. Amazon Cognito generates MFA prompts in API responses and in managed login for users who have chosen and configured a preferred MFA factor.
            policies: The password policy and sign-in policy in the user pool. The password policy sets options like password complexity requirements and password history. The sign-in policy sets the options available to applications in [choice-based authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-selection-sdk.html#authentication-flows-selection-choice).
            pool-name: The updated name of your user pool.
            sms-authentication-message: The contents of the SMS message that your user pool sends to users in SMS authentication.
            sms-configuration: The SMS configuration with the settings for your Amazon Cognito user pool to send SMS message with Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account. For more information see [SMS message settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html).
            sms-verification-message: This parameter is no longer used.
            user-attribute-update-settings: The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the property `AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate`, a user-pool setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value of your users' email address and phone number attributes. For more information, see [Verifying updates to email addresses and phone numbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html#user-pool-settings-verifications-verify-attribute-updates).
            user-pool-add-ons: |-
                Contains settings for activation of threat protection, including the operating mode and additional authentication types. To log user security information but take no action, set to `AUDIT`. To configure automatic security responses to potentially unwanted traffic to your user pool, set to `ENFORCED`.

                For more information, see [Adding advanced security to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html). To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the [Plus tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-plus.html).
            user-pool-id: The ID of the user pool you want to update.
            user-pool-tags: The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
            user-pool-tier: The user pool [feature plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sign-in-feature-plans.html), or tier. This parameter determines the eligibility of the user pool for features like managed login, access-token customization, and threat protection. Defaults to `ESSENTIALS`.
            verification-message-template: |-
                The template for the verification message that your user pool delivers to users who set an email address or phone number attribute.

                Set the email message type that corresponds to your `DefaultEmailOption` selection. For `CONFIRM_WITH_LINK`, specify an `EmailMessageByLink` and leave `EmailMessage` blank. For `CONFIRM_WITH_CODE`, specify an `EmailMessage` and leave `EmailMessageByLink` blank. When you supply both parameters with either choice, Amazon Cognito returns an error.

        command: |-
            Begins the password reset process. Sets the requested user’s account into a `RESET_REQUIRED` status, and sends them a password-reset code. Your user pool also sends the user a notification with a reset code and the information that their password has been reset. At sign-in, your application or the managed login session receives a challenge to complete the reset by confirming the code and setting a new password.

            To use this API operation, your user pool must have self-service account recovery configured.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. The `AdminResetUserPassword` API operation invokes the function that is assigned to the *custom message* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminResetUserPassword request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

                The authentication flow that you want to initiate. Each `AuthFlow` has linked `AuthParameters` that you must submit. The following are some example flows.

                USER\_AUTH

                The entry point for [choice-based authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-selection-sdk.html#authentication-flows-selection-choice) with passwords, one-time passwords, and WebAuthn authenticators. Request a preferred authentication type or review available authentication types. From the offered authentication types, select one in a challenge response and then authenticate with that method in an additional challenge response. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the [Essentials tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html) or higher.

                USER\_SRP\_AUTH

                Username-password authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. For more information, see [Use SRP password verification in custom authentication flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html#Using-SRP-password-verification-in-custom-authentication-flow).

                REFRESH\_TOKEN\_AUTH and REFRESH\_TOKEN

                Receive new ID and access tokens when you pass a `REFRESH_TOKEN` parameter with a valid refresh token as the value. For more information, see [Using the refresh token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.html).

                CUSTOM\_AUTH

                Custom authentication with Lambda triggers. For more information, see [Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-challenge.html).

                USER\_PASSWORD\_AUTH

                Client-side username-password authentication with the password sent directly in the request. For more information about client-side and server-side authentication, see [SDK authorization models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-public-server-side.html).

                `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` is a flow type of `AdminInitiateAuth` and isn't valid for InitiateAuth. `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` is a legacy server-side username-password flow and isn't valid for InitiateAuth.
            auth-parameters: |-
                The authentication parameters. These are inputs corresponding to the `AuthFlow` that you're invoking.

                The following are some authentication flows and their parameters. Add a `SECRET_HASH` parameter if your app client has a client secret. Add `DEVICE_KEY` if you want to bypass multi-factor authentication with a remembered device.

                USER\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `PREFERRED_CHALLENGE`. If you don't provide a value for `PREFERRED_CHALLENGE`, Amazon Cognito responds with the `AvailableChallenges` parameter that specifies the available sign-in methods.

                USER\_SRP\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `SRP_A` (required)

                USER\_PASSWORD\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `PASSWORD` (required)

                REFRESH\_TOKEN\_AUTH/REFRESH\_TOKEN

                - `REFRESH_TOKEN`(required)

                CUSTOM\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `ChallengeName: SRP_A` (when doing SRP authentication before custom challenges)
                - `SRP_A: (An SRP_A value)` (when doing SRP authentication before custom challenges)

            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for certain custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you send an `InitiateAuth` request, Amazon Cognito invokes the Lambda functions that are specified for various triggers. The `ClientMetadata` value is passed as input to the functions for only the following triggers.

                - Pre sign-up
                - Pre authentication
                - User migration

                When Amazon Cognito invokes the functions for these triggers, it passes a JSON payload as input to the function. This payload contains a `validationData` attribute with the data that you assigned to the `ClientMetadata` parameter in your `InitiateAuth` request. In your function, `validationData` can contribute to operations that require data that isn't in the default payload.

                `InitiateAuth` requests invokes the following triggers without `ClientMetadata` as input.

                - Post authentication
                - Custom message
                - Pre token generation
                - Create auth challenge
                - Define auth challenge
                - Custom email sender
                - Custom SMS sender

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            session: The optional session ID from a `ConfirmSignUp` API request. You can sign in a user directly from the sign-up process with the `USER_AUTH` authentication flow. When you pass the session ID to `InitiateAuth`, Amazon Cognito assumes the SMS or email message one-time verification password from `ConfirmSignUp` as the primary authentication factor. You're not required to submit this code a second time. This option is only valid for users who have confirmed their sign-up and are signing in for the first time within the authentication flow session duration of the session ID.

            Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant IAM permissions in policies.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the ResendConfirmationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *custom message* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ResendConfirmationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

            Sets the specified user's password in a user pool. This operation administratively sets a temporary or permanent password for a user. With this operation, you can bypass self-service password changes and permit immediate sign-in with the password that you set. To do this, set `Permanent` to `true`.

            You can also set a new temporary password in this request, send it to a user, and require them to choose a new password on their next sign-in. To do this, set `Permanent` to `false`.

            If the password is temporary, the user's `Status` becomes `FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD`. When the user next tries to sign in, the `InitiateAuth` or `AdminInitiateAuth` response includes the `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge. If the user doesn't sign in before the temporary password expires, they can no longer sign in and you must repeat this operation to set a temporary or permanent password for them.

            After the user sets a new password, or if you set a permanent password, their status becomes `Confirmed`.

            `AdminSetUserPassword` can set a password for the user profile that Amazon Cognito creates for third-party federated users. When you set a password, the federated user's status changes from `EXTERNAL_PROVIDER` to `CONFIRMED`. A user in this state can sign in as a federated user, and initiate authentication flows in the API like a linked native user. They can also modify their password and attributes in token-authenticated API requests like `ChangePassword` and `UpdateUserAttributes`. As a best security practice and to keep users in sync with your external IdP, don't set passwords on federated user profiles. To set up a federated user for native sign-in with a linked native user, refer to [Linking federated users to an existing user profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html).

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                USER\_AUTH

                The entry point for [choice-based authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-selection-sdk.html#authentication-flows-selection-choice) with passwords, one-time passwords, and WebAuthn authenticators. Request a preferred authentication type or review available authentication types. From the offered authentication types, select one in a challenge response and then authenticate with that method in an additional challenge response. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the [Essentials tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html) or higher.

                USER\_SRP\_AUTH

                Username-password authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. For more information, see [Use SRP password verification in custom authentication flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html#Using-SRP-password-verification-in-custom-authentication-flow).

                Receive new ID and access tokens when you pass a `REFRESH_TOKEN` parameter with a valid refresh token as the value. For more information, see [Using the refresh token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.html).

                CUSTOM\_AUTH

                Custom authentication with Lambda triggers. For more information, see [Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-challenge.html).

                ADMIN\_USER\_PASSWORD\_AUTH

                Server-side username-password authentication with the password sent directly in the request. For more information about client-side and server-side authentication, see [SDK authorization models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-public-server-side.html).
            auth-parameters: |-
                The authentication parameters. These are inputs corresponding to the `AuthFlow` that you're invoking.

                The following are some authentication flows and their parameters. Add a `SECRET_HASH` parameter if your app client has a client secret. Add `DEVICE_KEY` if you want to bypass multi-factor authentication with a remembered device.

                USER\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `PREFERRED_CHALLENGE`. If you don't provide a value for `PREFERRED_CHALLENGE`, Amazon Cognito responds with the `AvailableChallenges` parameter that specifies the available sign-in methods.

                USER\_SRP\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `SRP_A` (required)

                ADMIN\_USER\_PASSWORD\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `PASSWORD` (required)

                REFRESH\_TOKEN\_AUTH/REFRESH\_TOKEN

                - `REFRESH_TOKEN`(required)

                CUSTOM\_AUTH

                - `USERNAME` (required)
                - `ChallengeName: SRP_A` (when preceding custom authentication with SRP authentication)
                - `SRP_A: (An SRP_A value)` (when preceding custom authentication with SRP authentication)

            client-id: The ID of the app client where the user wants to sign in.
            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for certain custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminInitiateAuth API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the Lambda functions that are specified for various triggers. The ClientMetadata value is passed as input to the functions for only the following triggers:

                - Pre signup
                - Pre authentication
                - User migration

                When Amazon Cognito invokes the functions for these triggers, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `validationData` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminInitiateAuth request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `validationData` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                When you use the AdminInitiateAuth API action, Amazon Cognito also invokes the functions for the following triggers, but it doesn't provide the ClientMetadata value as input:

                - Post authentication
                - Custom message
                - Pre token generation
                - Create auth challenge
                - Define auth challenge
                - Custom email sender
                - Custom SMS sender

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.
            context-data: |-
                Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

            Creates an app client in a user pool. This operation sets basic and advanced configuration options.

            Unlike app clients created in the console, Amazon Cognito doesn't automatically assign a branding style to app clients that you configure with this API operation. Managed login and classic hosted UI pages aren't available for your client until after you apply a branding style.

            If you don't provide a value for an attribute, Amazon Cognito sets it to its default value.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

        flag:
            access-token-validity: |-
                The access token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their access token. To specify the time unit for `AccessTokenValidity` as `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`, set a `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.

                For example, when you set `AccessTokenValidity` to `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` to `hours`, your user can authorize access with their access token for 10 hours.

                The default time unit for `AccessTokenValidity` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

                If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your access tokens are valid for one hour.
            allowed-o-auth-flows: |-
                The OAuth grant types that you want your app client to generate for clients in managed login authentication. To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add `client_credentials` as the only allowed OAuth flow.

                code

                Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the `/oauth2/token` endpoint.

                implicit

                Issue the access token, and the ID token when scopes like `openid` and `profile` are requested, directly to your user.

                client\_credentials

                Issue the access token from the `/oauth2/token` endpoint directly to a non-person user, authorized by a combination of the client ID and client secret.
            allowed-o-auth-flows-user-pool-client: |-
                Set to `true` to use OAuth 2.0 authorization server features in your app client.

                This parameter must have a value of `true` before you can configure the following features in your app client.

                - `CallBackURLs`: Callback URLs.
                - `LogoutURLs`: Sign-out redirect URLs.
                - `AllowedOAuthScopes`: OAuth 2.0 scopes.
                - `AllowedOAuthFlows`: Support for authorization code, implicit, and client credentials OAuth 2.0 grants.

                To use authorization server features, configure one of these features in the Amazon Cognito console or set `AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient` to `true` in a `CreateUserPoolClient` or `UpdateUserPoolClient` API request. If you don't set a value for `AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient` in a request with the CLI or SDKs, it defaults to `false`. When `false`, only SDK-based API sign-in is permitted.
            allowed-o-auth-scopes: The OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and custom scopes that you want to permit your app client to authorize access with. Scopes govern access control to user pool self-service API operations, user data from the `userInfo` endpoint, and third-party APIs. Scope values include `phone`, `email`, `openid`, and `profile`. The `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin` scope authorizes user self-service operations. Custom scopes with resource servers authorize access to external APIs.
            analytics-configuration: |-
                The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign.

                In Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools might not have access to analytics or might be configurable with campaigns in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. For more information, see [Using Amazon Pinpoint analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.html).
            auth-session-validity: Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. `AuthSessionValidity` is the duration, in minutes, of that session token. Your user pool native user must respond to each authentication challenge before the session expires.
            callback-urls: |-
                A list of allowed redirect, or callback, URLs for managed login authentication. These URLs are the paths where you want to send your users' browsers after they complete authentication with managed login or a third-party IdP. Typically, callback URLs are the home of an application that uses OAuth or OIDC libraries to process authentication outcomes.

                A redirect URI must meet the following requirements:

                - Be an absolute URI.
                - Be registered with the authorization server. Amazon Cognito doesn't accept authorization requests with `redirect_uri` values that aren't in the list of `CallbackURLs` that you provide in this parameter.
                - Not include a fragment component.

                See [OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2).

                Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only.

                App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            client-name: A friendly name for the app client that you want to create.
            default-redirect-uri: The default redirect URI. In app clients with one assigned IdP, replaces `redirect_uri` in authentication requests. Must be in the `CallbackURLs` list.
            enable-propagate-additional-user-context-data: When `true`, your application can include additional `UserContextData` in authentication requests. This data includes the IP address, and contributes to analysis by threat protection features. For more information about propagation of user context data, see [Adding session data to API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint). If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send the source IP address to Amazon Cognito threat protection features. You can only activate `EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData` in an app client that has a client secret.
            enable-token-revocation: |-
                Activates or deactivates [token revocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-revocation.html) in the target app client.

                If you don't include this parameter, token revocation is automatically activated for the new user pool client.
            explicit-auth-flows: "The [authentication flows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods.html) that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions.\n\nIf you don't specify a value for `ExplicitAuthFlows`, your app client supports `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`, `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`, and `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`.\n\nThe values for authentication flow options include the following.\n\n- `ALLOW_USER_AUTH`: Enable selection-based sign-in with `USER_AUTH`. This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other `ExplicitAuthFlows` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through `USER_AUTH` without the flow `USER_SRP_AUTH` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include `CUSTOM_AUTH`.\n  \n  To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the [Essentials tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html) or higher.\n- `ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`: Enable admin based user password authentication flow `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`. This setting replaces the `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.\n- `ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.\n- `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.\n- `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`: Enable SRP-based authentication.\n- `ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`: Enable authflow to refresh tokens.\n\nIn some environments, you will see the values `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`, `CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY`, or `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`. You can't assign these legacy `ExplicitAuthFlows` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with `ALLOW_`, like `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`."
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            generate-secret: When `true`, generates a client secret for the app client. Client secrets are used with server-side and machine-to-machine applications. Client secrets are automatically generated; you can't specify a secret value. For more information, see [App client types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html#user-pool-settings-client-app-client-types).
            id-token-validity: |-
                The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their ID token. To specify the time unit for `IdTokenValidity` as `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`, set a `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.

                For example, when you set `IdTokenValidity` as `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` as `hours`, your user can authenticate their session with their ID token for 10 hours.

                The default time unit for `IdTokenValidity` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

                If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your ID tokens are valid for one hour.
            logout-urls: A list of allowed logout URLs for managed login authentication. When you pass `logout_uri` and `client_id` parameters to `/logout`, Amazon Cognito signs out your user and redirects them to the logout URL. This parameter describes the URLs that you want to be the permitted targets of `logout_uri`. A typical use of these URLs is when a user selects "Sign out" and you redirect them to your public homepage. For more information, see [Logout endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html).
            prevent-user-existence-errors: |-
                When `ENABLED`, suppresses messages that might indicate a valid user exists when someone attempts sign-in. This parameters sets your preference for the errors and responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to `ENABLED` and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to `LEGACY`, those APIs return a `UserNotFoundException` exception if the user doesn't exist in the user pool.

                Defaults to `LEGACY`.
            read-attributes: |-
                The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

                When you don't specify the `ReadAttributes` for your app client, your app can read the values of `email_verified`, `phone_number_verified`, and the standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool app client has read access to these default attributes, `ReadAttributes` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates `ReadAttributes` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.
            refresh-token-rotation: The configuration of your app client for refresh token rotation. When enabled, your app client issues new ID, access, and refresh tokens when users renew their sessions with refresh tokens. When disabled, token refresh issues only ID and access tokens.
            refresh-token-validity: |-
                The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their refresh token. To specify the time unit for `RefreshTokenValidity` as `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, or `days`, set a `TokenValidityUnits` value in your API request.

                For example, when you set `RefreshTokenValidity` as `10` and `TokenValidityUnits` as `days`, your user can refresh their session and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days.

                The default time unit for `RefreshTokenValidity` in an API request is days. You can't set `RefreshTokenValidity` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default value of 30 days. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

                If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.
            supported-identity-providers: |-
                A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: `COGNITO`, `Facebook`, `Google`, `SignInWithApple`, and `LoginWithAmazon`. You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example `MySAMLIdP` or `MyOIDCIdP`.

                This parameter sets the IdPs that [managed login](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html) will display on the login page for your app client. The removal of `COGNITO` from this list doesn't prevent authentication operations for local users with the user pools API in an Amazon Web Services SDK. The only way to prevent SDK-based authentication is to block access with a [WAF rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-waf.html).
            token-validity-units: The units that validity times are represented in. The default unit for refresh tokens is days, and the default for ID and access tokens are hours.
            user-pool-id: The ID of the user pool where you want to create an app client.
            write-attributes: |-
                The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

                When you don't specify the `WriteAttributes` for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, `WriteAttributes` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates `WriteAttributes` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes.

                If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see [Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html).

            Confirms the account of a new user. This public API operation submits a code that Amazon Cognito sent to your user when they signed up in your user pool. After your user enters their code, they confirm ownership of the email address or phone number that they provided, and their user account becomes active. Depending on your user pool configuration, your users will receive their confirmation code in an email or SMS message.

            Local users who signed up in your user pool are the only type of user who can confirm sign-up with a code. Users who federate through an external identity provider (IdP) have already been confirmed by their IdP.

            client-metadata: |-
                A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

                You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the ConfirmSignUp API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *post confirmation* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ConfirmSignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

                For more information, see [Using Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

                When you use the `ClientMetadata` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

                - Store the `ClientMetadata` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the `ClientMetadata` parameter serves no purpose.
                - Validate the `ClientMetadata` value.
                - Encrypt the `ClientMetadata` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.
            confirmation-code: The confirmation code that your user pool sent in response to the `SignUp` request.
            force-alias-creation: |-
                When `true`, forces user confirmation despite any existing aliases. Defaults to `false`. A value of `true` migrates the alias from an existing user to the new user if an existing user already has the phone number or email address as an alias.

                Say, for example, that an existing user has an `email` attribute of `bob@example.com` and email is an alias in your user pool. If the new user also has an email of `bob@example.com` and your `ConfirmSignUp` response sets `ForceAliasCreation` to `true`, the new user can sign in with a username of `bob@example.com` and the existing user can no longer do so.

                If `false` and an attribute belongs to an existing alias, this request returns an **AliasExistsException** error.

                For more information about sign-in aliases, see [Customizing sign-in attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases).

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production.

                Sets multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be on, off, or optional. When `ON`, all users must set up MFA before they can sign in. When `OPTIONAL`, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose `OPTIONAL`.

Groups with lower `Precedence` values take precedence over groups with higher or null `Precedence` values.

If two groups with the same `Precedence` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim isn't set in users' tokens.

            If you don't provide a value for an attribute, Amazon Cognito sets it to its default value.

            This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

            If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [*sandbox mode*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            deletion-protection: |-
                When active, `DeletionProtection` prevents accidental deletion of your user pool. Before you can delete a user pool that you have protected against deletion, you must deactivate this feature.

                When you try to delete a protected user pool in a `DeleteUserPool` API request, Amazon Cognito returns an `InvalidParameterException` error. To delete a protected user pool, send a new `DeleteUserPool` request after you deactivate deletion protection in an `UpdateUserPool` API request.
            device-configuration: |-
                The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. Device remembering or device tracking is a "Remember me on this device" option for user pools that perform authentication with the device key of a trusted device in the back end, instead of a user-provided MFA code. For more information about device authentication, see [Working with user devices in your user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html). A null value indicates that you have deactivated device remembering in your user pool.

                When you provide a value for any `DeviceConfiguration` field, you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature. For more information, see [Working with devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html).
            email-configuration: The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region, and sender for messages from your user pool.
            email-verification-message: This parameter is no longer used.
            email-verification-subject: This parameter is no longer used.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            lambda-config: A collection of user pool Lambda triggers. Amazon Cognito invokes triggers at several possible stages of authentication operations. Triggers can modify the outcome of the operations that invoked them.
            mfa-configuration: |-
                Sets multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be on, off, or optional. When `ON`, all users must set up MFA before they can sign in. When `OPTIONAL`, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose `OPTIONAL`.

                When `MfaConfiguration` is `OPTIONAL`, managed login doesn't automatically prompt users to set up MFA. Amazon Cognito generates MFA prompts in API responses and in managed login for users who have chosen and configured a preferred MFA factor.
            policies: The password policy and sign-in policy in the user pool. The password policy sets options like password complexity requirements and password history. The sign-in policy sets the options available to applications in [choice-based authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-selection-sdk.html#authentication-flows-selection-choice).
            pool-name: A friendly name for your user pool.
            schema: An array of attributes for the new user pool. You can add custom attributes and modify the properties of default attributes. The specifications in this parameter set the required attributes in your user pool. For more information, see [Working with user attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html).
            sms-authentication-message: The contents of the SMS message that your user pool sends to users in SMS OTP and MFA authentication.
            sms-configuration: The settings for your Amazon Cognito user pool to send SMS messages with Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account. For more information see [SMS message settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html).
            sms-verification-message: This parameter is no longer used.
            user-attribute-update-settings: The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the property `AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate`, a user-pool setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value of your users' email address and phone number attributes. For more information, see [Verifying updates to email addresses and phone numbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html#user-pool-settings-verifications-verify-attribute-updates).
            user-pool-add-ons: |-
                Contains settings for activation of threat protection, including the operating mode and additional authentication types. To log user security information but take no action, set to `AUDIT`. To configure automatic security responses to potentially unwanted traffic to your user pool, set to `ENFORCED`.

                For more information, see [Adding advanced security to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html). To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the [Plus tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-plus.html).
            user-pool-tags: The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
            user-pool-tier: The user pool [feature plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sign-in-feature-plans.html), or tier. This parameter determines the eligibility of the user pool for features like managed login, access-token customization, and threat protection. Defaults to `ESSENTIALS`.
            username-attributes: Specifies whether a user can use an email address or phone number as a username when they sign up. For more information, see [Customizing sign-in attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases).
            username-configuration: |-
                Sets the case sensitivity option for sign-in usernames. When `CaseSensitive` is `false` (case insensitive), users can sign in with any combination of capital and lowercase letters. For example, `username`, `USERNAME`, or `UserName`, or for email, `email@example.com` or `EMaiL@eXamplE.Com`. For most use cases, set case sensitivity to `false` as a best practice. When usernames and email addresses are case insensitive, Amazon Cognito treats any variation in case as the same user, and prevents a case variation from being assigned to the same attribute for a different user.

                When `CaseSensitive` is `true` (case sensitive), Amazon Cognito interprets `USERNAME` and `UserName` as distinct users.

                This configuration is immutable after you set it.
            verification-message-template: |-
                The template for the verification message that your user pool delivers to users who set an email address or phone number attribute.

                Set the email message type that corresponds to your `DefaultEmailOption` selection. For `CONFIRM_WITH_LINK`, specify an `EmailMessageByLink` and leave `EmailMessage` blank. For `CONFIRM_WITH_CODE`, specify an `EmailMessage` and leave `EmailMessageByLink` blank. When you supply both parameters with either choice, Amazon Cognito returns an error.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            next-token: This API operation returns a limited number of results. The pagination token is an identifier that you can present in an additional API request with the same parameters. When you include the pagination token, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items after the current list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token. By use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Configures the branding settings for a user pool style. This operation is the programmatic option for the configuration of a style in the branding editor.

            Provides values for UI customization in a `Settings` JSON object and image files in an `Assets` array.

            This operation has a 2-megabyte request-size limit and include the CSS settings and image assets for your app client. Your branding settings might exceed 2MB in size. Amazon Cognito doesn't require that you pass all parameters in one request and preserves existing style settings that you don't specify. If your request is larger than 2MB, separate it into multiple requests, each with a size smaller than the limit.

            Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

The user's response indicates that you think that the event either was from a valid user or was an unwanted authentication attempt. This feedback improves the risk evaluation decision for the user pool as part of Amazon Cognito threat protection. To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the [Plus tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-plus.html).

            This operation requires a `FeedbackToken` that Amazon Cognito generates and adds to notification emails when users have potentially suspicious authentication events. Users invoke this operation when they select the link that corresponds to `{one-click-link-valid}` or `{one-click-link-invalid}` in your notification template. Because `FeedbackToken` is a required parameter, you can't make requests to `UpdateAuthEventFeedback` without the contents of the notification email message.

        With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API, you can [link IdP users to native user profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html). Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users at [Adding user pool sign-in through a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html) and in the [User pool federation endpoints and managed login reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html).

        This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object types in Amazon Cognito.

        Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.

        1. An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients, users, groups, or other user pool functions.
        2. A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Amazon Web Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.
        3. A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make unauthenticated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.

        For more information, see [Understanding API, OIDC, and managed login pages authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-public-server-side.html#user-pools-API-operations) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

        With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic to support operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make direct REST API requests to [Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cognito_identity.html#cognito_identity_your_user_pools_region). The following links can get you started with the `CognitoIdentityProvider` client in supported Amazon Web Services SDKs.

        To get started with an Amazon Web Services SDK, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/). For example actions and scenarios, see [Code examples for Amazon Cognito Identity Provider using Amazon Web Services SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/service_code_examples_cognito-identity-provider.html).
