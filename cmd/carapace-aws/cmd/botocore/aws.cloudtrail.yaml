        command: |-
            Lets you enable Insights event logging on specific event categories by specifying the Insights selectors that you want to enable on an existing trail or event data store. You also use `PutInsightSelectors` to turn off Insights event logging, by passing an empty list of Insights types. The valid Insights event types are `ApiErrorRateInsight` and `ApiCallRateInsight`, and valid EventCategories are `Management` and `Data`.

            Insights on data events are not supported on event data stores. For event data stores, you can only enable Insights on management events.

            To enable Insights on an event data store, you must specify the ARNs (or ID suffix of the ARNs) for the source event data store (`EventDataStore`) and the destination event data store (`InsightsDestination`). The source event data store logs management events and enables Insights. The destination event data store logs Insights events based upon the management event activity of the source event data store. The source and destination event data stores must belong to the same Amazon Web Services account.

            To log Insights events for a trail, you must specify the name (`TrailName`) of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add Insights selectors.

            - For Management events Insights: To log CloudTrail Insights on the API call rate, the trail or event data store must log `write` management events. To log CloudTrail Insights on the API error rate, the trail or event data store must log `read` or `write` management events.
            - For Data events Insights: To log CloudTrail Insights on the API call rate or API error rate, the trail must log `read` or `write` data events. Data events Insights are not supported on event data store.

            To log CloudTrail Insights events on API call volume, the trail or event data store must log `write` management events. To log CloudTrail Insights events on API error rate, the trail or event data store must log `read` or `write` management events. You can call `GetEventSelectors` on a trail to check whether the trail logs management events. You can call `GetEventDataStore` on an event data store to check whether the event data store logs management events.

            For more information, see [Working with CloudTrail Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

            Enables Lake query federation on the specified event data store. Federating an event data store lets you view the metadata associated with the event data store in the Glue [Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/components-overview.html#data-catalog-intro) and run SQL queries against your event data using Amazon Athena. The table metadata stored in the Glue Data Catalog lets the Athena query engine know how to find, read, and process the data that you want to query.

            When you enable Lake query federation, CloudTrail creates a managed database named `aws:cloudtrail` (if the database doesn't already exist) and a managed federated table in the Glue Data Catalog. The event data store ID is used for the table name. CloudTrail registers the role ARN and event data store in [Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-federation-lake-formation.html), the service responsible for allowing fine-grained access control of the federated resources in the Glue Data Catalog.

            kms-key-id: |-
                Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

                Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.

                CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

                Examples:

                - `alias/MyAliasName`
                - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`
                - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
                - `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
            multi-region-enabled: Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all Regions, or only from the Region in which the event data store is created.
            name: The name of the event data store.
            organization-enabled: Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in Organizations.
            retention-period: |-
                The retention period of the event data store, in days. If `BillingMode` is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If `BillingMode` is set to `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

                CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the `eventTime` of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events when the `eventTime` is older than 90 days.

                If you plan to copy trail events to this event data store, we recommend that you consider both the age of the events that you want to copy as well as how long you want to keep the copied events in your event data store. For example, if you copy trail events that are 5 years old and specify a retention period of 7 years, the event data store will retain those events for two years.
            start-ingestion: Specifies whether the event data store should start ingesting live events. The default is true.
            tags-list: ""
            termination-protection-enabled: Specifies whether termination protection is enabled for the event data store. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot delete the event data store until termination protection is disabled.

            Configures event selectors (also referred to as *basic event selectors*) or advanced event selectors for your trail. You can use either `AdvancedEventSelectors` or `EventSelectors`, but not both. If you apply `AdvancedEventSelectors` to a trail, any existing `EventSelectors` are overwritten.

            You can use `AdvancedEventSelectors` to log management events, data events for all resource types, and network activity events.

            You can use `EventSelectors` to log management events and data events for the following resource types:

            - `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`
            - `AWS::Lambda::Function`
            - `AWS::S3::Object`

            You can't use `EventSelectors` to log network activity events.

            If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selector or advanced event selector enables logging of the Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more information about logging Insights events, see [Working with CloudTrail Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the *CloudTrail User Guide*. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events or network activity events.

            When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

            Example

            1. You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want to log write-only events.
            2. The EC2 `GetConsoleOutput` and `RunInstances` API operations occur in your account.
            3. CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
            4. The `RunInstances` is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
            5. The `GetConsoleOutput` is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.

            The `PutEventSelectors` operation must be called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an `InvalidHomeRegionException` exception is thrown.

            You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail.

            You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail.

            Deletes a trail. This operation must be called from the Region in which the trail was created. `DeleteTrail` cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated trails in other Regions) of a trail that is enabled in all Regions.

            While deleting a CloudTrail trail is an irreversible action, CloudTrail does not delete log files in the Amazon S3 bucket for that trail, the Amazon S3 bucket itself, or the CloudWatchlog group to which the trail delivers events. Deleting a multi-Region trail will stop logging of events in all Amazon Web Services Regions enabled in your Amazon Web Services account. Deleting a single-Region trail will stop logging of events in that Region only. It will not stop logging of events in other Regions even if the trails in those other Regions have identical names to the deleted trail.

You can look up events that occurred in a Region within the last 90 days.

            `LookupEvents` returns recent Insights events for trails that enable Insights. To view Insights events for an event data store, you can run queries on your Insights event data store, and you can also view the Lake dashboard for Insights.

            Lookup supports the following attributes for management events:

            - Amazon Web Services access key
            - Event ID
            - Event name
            - Event source
            - Read only
            - Resource name
            - Resource type

            - Event ID
            - Event name
            - Event source

            All attributes are optional. The default number of results returned is 50, with a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to get the next page of results.

            The rate of lookup requests is limited to two per second, per account, per Region. If this limit is exceeded, a throttling error occurs.

            For event data stores for CloudTrail events, `AdvancedEventSelectors` includes or excludes management, data, or network activity events in your event data store. For more information about `AdvancedEventSelectors`, see [AdvancedEventSelectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html).

If `BillingMode` is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` and you want to use `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` instead, you'll need to stop ingestion on the event data store and create a new event data store that uses `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`.

                The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store.

                The following are the possible values:

                - `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is 366 days.
                - `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.

                Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.

                CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

                Examples:

                - `alias/MyAliasName`
                - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`

            multi-region-enabled: Specifies whether an event data store collects events from all Regions, or only from the Region in which it was created.

            organization-enabled: |-
                Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in Organizations.

                Only the management account for the organization can convert an organization event data store to a non-organization event data store, or convert a non-organization event data store to an organization event data store.
            retention-period: |-
                The retention period of the event data store, in days. If `BillingMode` is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If `BillingMode` is set to `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

                CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the `eventTime` of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events when the `eventTime` is older than 90 days.

                If you decrease the retention period of an event data store, CloudTrail will remove any events with an `eventTime` older than the new retention period. For example, if the previous retention period was 365 days and you decrease it to 100 days, CloudTrail will remove events with an `eventTime` older than 100 days.

            Creates a custom dashboard or the Highlights dashboard.

            - **Custom dashboards** - Custom dashboards allow you to query events in any event data store type. You can add up to 10 widgets to a custom dashboard. You can manually refresh a custom dashboard, or you can set a refresh schedule.
            - **Highlights dashboard** - You can create the Highlights dashboard to see a summary of key user activities and API usage across all your event data stores. CloudTrail Lake manages the Highlights dashboard and refreshes the dashboard every 6 hours. To create the Highlights dashboard, you must set and enable a refresh schedule.

            CloudTrail runs queries to populate the dashboard's widgets during a manual or scheduled refresh. CloudTrail must be granted permissions to run the `StartQuery` operation on your behalf. To provide permissions, run the `PutResourcePolicy` operation to attach a resource-based policy to each event data store. For more information, see [Example: Allow CloudTrail to run queries to populate a dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples.html#security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-eds-dashboard) in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

            To set a refresh schedule, CloudTrail must be granted permissions to run the `StartDashboardRefresh` operation to refresh the dashboard on your behalf.

By default, CloudTrail only imports events contained in the S3 bucket's `CloudTrail` prefix and the prefixes inside the `CloudTrail` prefix, and does not check prefixes for other Amazon Web Services services. If you want to import CloudTrail events contained in another prefix, you must include the prefix in the `S3LocationUri`. For more considerations about importing trail events, see [Considerations for copying trail events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake.html#cloudtrail-trail-copy-considerations) in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

            When you start a new import, the `Destinations` and `ImportSource` parameters are required. Before starting a new import, disable any access control lists (ACLs) attached to the source S3 bucket. For more information about disabling ACLs, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html).

            When you retry an import, the `ImportID` parameter is required.

            If the destination event data store is for an organization, you must use the management account to import trail events. You cannot use the delegated administrator account for the organization.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn: |-
                Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs are delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your account.

                Not required unless you specify `CloudWatchLogsRoleArn`.
            cloud-watch-logs-role-arn: Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your account.
            enable-log-file-validation: |-
                Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.

                When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            include-global-service-events: Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.
            is-multi-region-trail: Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current Region or to all Regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current Region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the other Regions. If the trail exists in all Regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the Region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other Regions will be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all Regions.
            is-organization-trail: |-
                Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an organization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web Services account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the management account for an organization in Organizations. If the trail is not an organization trail and this is set to `true`, the trail will be created in all Amazon Web Services accounts that belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to `false`, the trail will remain in the current Amazon Web Services account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.

                Only the management account for the organization can convert an organization trail to a non-organization trail, or convert a non-organization trail to an organization trail.
            kms-key-id: |-
                Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs and digest files delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

                CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

                Examples:

                - alias/MyAliasName
                - arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
                - arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
                - 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
            name: |-
                Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If `Name` is a trail name, the string must meet the following requirements:

                - Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (\_), or dashes (-)
                - Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number
                - Be between 3 and 128 characters
                - Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like `my-_namespace` and `my--namespace` are not valid.
                - Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

                If `Name` is a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.

                `arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`
            s3-bucket-name: Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files. See [Amazon S3 Bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
            s3-key-prefix: Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/get-and-view-cloudtrail-log-files.html#cloudtrail-find-log-files). The maximum length is 200 characters.
            sns-topic-name: Specifies the name or ARN of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

        CloudTrail

        This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

        CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.

        As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

        See the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.
