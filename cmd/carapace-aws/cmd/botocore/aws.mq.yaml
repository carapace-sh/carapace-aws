            data-replication-mode: Defines whether this broker is a part of a data replication pair.
            data-replication-primary-broker-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the primary broker that is used to replicate data from in a data replication pair, and is applied to the replica broker. Must be set when dataReplicationMode is set to CRDR.

For more information, see the [ActiveMQ version management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/activemq-version-management.html) and the [RabbitMQ version management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/rabbitmq-version-management.html) sections in the Amazon MQ Developer Guide.

            subnet-ids: |-
                The list of groups that define which subnets and IP ranges the broker can use from different Availability Zones. If you specify more than one subnet, the subnets must be in different Availability Zones. Amazon MQ will not be able to create VPC endpoints for your broker with multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone. A SINGLE\_INSTANCE deployment requires one subnet (for example, the default subnet). An ACTIVE\_STANDBY\_MULTI\_AZ Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ deployment requires two subnets. A CLUSTER\_MULTI\_AZ Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ deployment has no subnet requirements when deployed with public accessibility. Deployment without public accessibility requires at least one subnet.

                If you specify subnets in a [shared VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html) for a RabbitMQ broker, the associated VPC to which the specified subnets belong must be owned by your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon MQ will not be able to create VPC endpoints in VPCs that are not owned by your Amazon Web Services account.
            tags: Create tags when creating the broker.
            users: The list of broker users (persons or applications) who can access queues and topics. For Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers, an administrative user is required if using simple authentication and authorization. For brokers using OAuth2, this user is optional. When provided, one and only one administrative user is accepted and created when a broker is first provisioned. All subsequent broker users are created by making RabbitMQ API calls directly to brokers or via the RabbitMQ web console.
