name: decrypt
description: |-
    Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a KMS key using any of the following operations:

    - [Encrypt]()
    - [GenerateDataKey]()
    - [GenerateDataKeyPair]()
    - [GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext]()
    - [GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext]()

    You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key or an asymmetric encryption KMS key.
flags:
    --ciphertext-blob=!: Ciphertext to be decrypted.
    --dry-run=: Checks if your request will succeed.
    --encryption-algorithm=: Specifies the encryption algorithm that will be used to decrypt the ciphertext.
    --encryption-context=: Specifies the encryption context to use when decrypting the data.
    --grant-tokens=: A list of grant tokens.
    --key-id=: Specifies the KMS key that KMS uses to decrypt the ciphertext.
    --recipient=: A signed [attestation document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-concepts.html#term-attestdoc) from an Amazon Web Services Nitro enclave or NitroTPM, and the encryption algorithm to use with the public key in the attestation document.
