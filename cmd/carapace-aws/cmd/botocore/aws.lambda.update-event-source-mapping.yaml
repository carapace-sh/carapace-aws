description: Updates an event source mapping.
flags:
    --amazon-managed-kafka-event-source-config=: ""
    --batch-size=: The maximum number of records in each batch that Lambda pulls from your stream or queue and sends to your function.
    --bisect-batch-on-function-error=: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) If the function returns an error, split the batch in two and retry.
    --destination-config=: (Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams, Amazon MSK, and self-managed Kafka only) A configuration object that specifies the destination of an event after Lambda processes it.
    --document-db-event-source-config=: Specific configuration settings for a DocumentDB event source.
    --enabled=: When true, the event source mapping is active.
    --filter-criteria=: An object that defines the filter criteria that determine whether Lambda should process an event.
    --function-name=: The name or ARN of the Lambda function.
    --function-response-types=: (Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams, and Amazon SQS) A list of current response type enums applied to the event source mapping.
    --kms-key-arn=: The ARN of the Key Management Service (KMS) customer managed key that Lambda uses to encrypt your function's [filter criteria](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventfiltering.html#filtering-basics). By default, Lambda does not encrypt your filter criteria object.
    --maximum-batching-window-in-seconds=: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that Lambda spends gathering records before invoking the function.
    --maximum-record-age-in-seconds=: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records older than the specified age.
    --maximum-retry-attempts=: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records after the specified number of retries.
    --metrics-config=: The metrics configuration for your event source.
    --parallelization-factor=: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The number of batches to process from each shard concurrently.
    --provisioned-poller-config=: (Amazon MSK and self-managed Apache Kafka only) The provisioned mode configuration for the event source.
    --scaling-config=: (Amazon SQS only) The scaling configuration for the event source.
    --self-managed-kafka-event-source-config=: ""
    --source-access-configurations=: An array of authentication protocols or VPC components required to secure your event source.
    --tumbling-window-in-seconds=: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The duration in seconds of a processing window for DynamoDB and Kinesis Streams event sources.
    --uuid=!: The identifier of the event source mapping.
