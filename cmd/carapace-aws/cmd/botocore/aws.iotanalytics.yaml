        command: Used to create a dataset. A dataset stores data retrieved from a data store by applying a `queryAction` (a SQL query) or a `containerAction` (executing a containerized application). This operation creates the skeleton of a dataset. The dataset can be populated manually by calling `CreateDatasetContent` or automatically according to a trigger you specify.

            late-data-rules: A list of data rules that send notifications to CloudWatch, when data arrives late. To specify `lateDataRules`, the dataset must use a [DeltaTimer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DeltaTime.html) filter.
            retention-period: Optional. How long, in days, versions of dataset contents are kept for the dataset. If not specified or set to `null`, versions of dataset contents are retained for at most 90 days. The number of versions of dataset contents retained is determined by the `versioningConfiguration` parameter. For more information, see [Keeping Multiple Versions of IoT Analytics datasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#aws-iot-analytics-dataset-versions) in the *IoT Analytics User Guide*.
            tags: Metadata which can be used to manage the dataset.
            triggers: A list of triggers. A trigger causes dataset contents to be populated at a specified time interval or when another dataset's contents are created. The list of triggers can be empty or contain up to five `DataSetTrigger` objects.
            versioning-configuration: Optional. How many versions of dataset contents are kept. If not specified or set to null, only the latest version plus the latest succeeded version (if they are different) are kept for the time period specified by the `retentionPeriod` parameter.

            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
