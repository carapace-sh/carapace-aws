                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The total number of items to return. If the total number of available items is more than the value specified in `MaxResults`, then a `NextToken` is returned in the output. You can use this token to display the next page of results.
            next-token: A token to display the next page of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-order: 'Optional. The order for displaying results. Valid values: `Ascending` and `Descending`.'
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
