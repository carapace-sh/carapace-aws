            Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the [ListCertificateAuthorities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ListCertificateAuthorities.html) action.

            Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.

            Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the [UpdateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html) action and set the **CertificateAuthorityStatus** parameter to `DISABLED`.

            Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is `CREATING`). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into Amazon Web Services Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is `PENDING_CERTIFICATE`).

            When you successfully call [DeleteCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCertificateAuthority.html), the CA's status changes to `DELETED`. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the `PermanentDeletionTimeInDays` parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The [DescribeCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCertificateAuthority.html) action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the `DELETED` state. To restore an eligible CA, call the [RestoreCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreCertificateAuthority.html) action.

            A private CA can be deleted if it is in the `PENDING_CERTIFICATE`, `CREATING`, `EXPIRED`, `DISABLED`, or `FAILED` state. To delete a CA in the `ACTIVE` state, you must first disable it, or else the delete request results in an exception. If you are deleting a private CA in the `PENDING_CERTIFICATE` or `DISABLED` state, you can set the length of its restoration period to 7-30 days. The default is 30. During this time, the status is set to `DELETED` and the CA can be restored. A private CA deleted in the `CREATING` or `FAILED` state has no assigned restoration period and cannot be restored.

            Revokes permissions on a private CA granted to the Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

            These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same Amazon Web Services account as the CA. If you revoke these permissions, ACM will no longer renew the affected certificates automatically.

            Permissions can be granted with the [CreatePermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePermission.html) action and listed with the [ListPermissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ListPermissions.html) action.

            **About Permissions**

            - If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use `CreatePermission` to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.
            - For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.
            - If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html).

            Deletes the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. Deletion will remove any access that the policy has granted. If there is no policy attached to the private CA, this action will return successful.

            If you delete a policy that was applied through Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in which it was included.

            The Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is not affected when you delete the policy.

            The current policy can be shown with [GetPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html) and updated with [PutPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_PutPolicy.html).

            **About Policies**

            - A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html).
            - A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.
            - For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more information, see [Using a Service Linked Role with ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html).
            - Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see [Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html).

            Imports a signed private CA certificate into Amazon Web Services Private CA. This action is used when you are using a chain of trust whose root is located outside Amazon Web Services Private CA. Before you can call this action, the following preparations must in place:

            1. In Amazon Web Services Private CA, call the [CreateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html) action to create the private CA that you plan to back with the imported certificate.
            2. Call the [GetCertificateAuthorityCsr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_GetCertificateAuthorityCsr.html) action to generate a certificate signing request (CSR).
            3. Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted by either an on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.
            4. Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory.

            Amazon Web Services Private CA supports three scenarios for installing a CA certificate:

            - Installing a certificate for a root CA hosted by Amazon Web Services Private CA.
            - Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is hosted by Amazon Web Services Private CA.
            - Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is externally hosted.

            The following additional requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.

            - Only a self-signed certificate can be imported as a root CA.
            - A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate CA.
            - Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are importing.
            - Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordinate certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built.
            - The chain must be PEM-encoded.
            - The maximum allowed size of a certificate is 32 KB.
            - The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.

            *Enforcement of Critical Constraints*

            Amazon Web Services Private CA allows the following extensions to be marked critical in the imported CA certificate or chain.

            - Authority key identifier
            - Basic constraints (*must* be marked critical)
            - Certificate policies
            - Extended key usage
            - Inhibit anyPolicy
            - Issuer alternative name
            - Key usage
            - Name constraints
            - Policy mappings
            - Subject alternative name
            - Subject directory attributes
            - Subject key identifier
            - Subject information access

            Amazon Web Services Private CA rejects the following extensions when they are marked critical in an imported CA certificate or chain.

            - Authority information access
            - CRL distribution points
            - Freshest CRL
            - Policy constraints

            Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority will also reject any other extension marked as critical not contained on the preceding list of allowed extensions.

            Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, an optional configuration for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or a certificate revocation list (CRL), the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The OCSP configuration can optionally specify a custom URL for the OCSP responder. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.

            Both Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see [Access policies for CRLs in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html#s3-policies).

            Amazon Web Services Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see [Encrypting Your CRLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html#crl-encryption).

            idempotency-token: Custom string that can be used to distinguish between calls to the **CreateCertificateAuthority** action. Idempotency tokens for **CreateCertificateAuthority** time out after five minutes. Therefore, if you call **CreateCertificateAuthority** multiple times with the same idempotency token within five minutes, Amazon Web Services Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only certificate authority and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, Amazon Web Services Private CA recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificate authorities.
            key-storage-security-standard: |-
                Specifies a cryptographic key management compliance standard for handling and protecting CA keys.

                Default: FIPS\_140\_2\_LEVEL\_3\_OR\_HIGHER

                Some Amazon Web Services Regions don't support the default value. When you create a CA in these Regions, you must use `CCPC_LEVEL_1_OR_HIGHER` for the `KeyStorageSecurityStandard` parameter. If you don't, the operation returns an `InvalidArgsException` with this message: "A certificate authority cannot be created in this region with the specified security standard."

                For information about security standard support in different Amazon Web Services Regions, see [Storage and security compliance of Amazon Web Services Private CA private keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#private-keys).

                Contains information to enable support for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), certificate revocation list (CRL), both protocols, or neither. By default, both certificate validation mechanisms are disabled.

                The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.

                - A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain only the `Enabled=False` parameter, and will fail if other parameters such as `CustomCname` or `ExpirationInDays` are included.
                - In a CRL configuration, the `S3BucketName` parameter must conform to [Amazon S3 bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
                - A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) parameter for CRLs or OCSP must conform to [RFC2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt) restrictions on the use of special characters in a CNAME.
                - In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                For more information, see the [OcspConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_OcspConfiguration.html) and [CrlConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html) types.

            A policy can also be applied by sharing a private CA through Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM). For more information, see [Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html).

            **About Policies**

            - A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html).
            - A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.
            - For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more information, see [Using a Service Linked Role with ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html).
            - Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see [Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html).

            Adds one or more tags to your private CA. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You specify the private CA on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair. You can apply a tag to just one private CA if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that CA, or you can apply the same tag to multiple private CAs if you want to filter for a common relationship among those CAs.

            Grants one or more permissions on a private CA to the Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (`acm.amazonaws.com`). These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same Amazon Web Services account as the CA.

            **About Permissions**

            - If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use `CreatePermission` to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.
            - For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.
            - If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals.

                `openssl req -new -config openssl_rsa.cnf -extensions usr_cert -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr`

                Note: A CSR must provide either a *subject name* or a *subject alternative name* or the request will be rejected.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            idempotency-token: Alphanumeric string that can be used to distinguish between calls to the **IssueCertificate** action. Idempotency tokens for **IssueCertificate** time out after five minutes. Therefore, if you call **IssueCertificate** multiple times with the same idempotency token within five minutes, Amazon Web Services Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, Amazon Web Services Private CA recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.
            signing-algorithm: |-
                The name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate to be issued.

                This parameter should not be confused with the `SigningAlgorithm` parameter used to sign a CSR in the `CreateCertificateAuthority` action.

                The specified signing algorithm family (RSA or ECDSA) must match the algorithm family of the CA's secret key.
            template-arn: |-
                Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a certificate. If this parameter is not provided, Amazon Web Services Private CA defaults to the `EndEntityCertificate/V1` template. For CA certificates, you should choose the shortest path length that meets your needs. The path length is indicated by the PathLen*N* portion of the ARN, where *N* is the [CA depth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaTerms.html#terms-cadepth).

                Note: The CA depth configured on a subordinate CA certificate must not exceed the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy.

                For a list of `TemplateArn` values supported by Amazon Web Services Private CA, see [Understanding Certificate Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html).
            validity: |-
                Information describing the end of the validity period of the certificate. This parameter sets the “Not After” date for the certificate.

                Certificate validity is the period of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit date and time when the certificate expires, or as a span of time after issuance, stated in days, months, or years. For more information, see [Validity](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5) in RFC 5280.

                This value is unaffected when `ValidityNotBefore` is also specified. For example, if `Validity` is set to 20 days in the future, the certificate will expire 20 days from issuance time regardless of the `ValidityNotBefore` value.

                The end of the validity period configured on a certificate must not exceed the limit set on its parents in the CA hierarchy.
            validity-not-before: |-
                Information describing the start of the validity period of the certificate. This parameter sets the “Not Before" date for the certificate.

                By default, when issuing a certificate, Amazon Web Services Private CA sets the "Not Before" date to the issuance time minus 60 minutes. This compensates for clock inconsistencies across computer systems. The `ValidityNotBefore` parameter can be used to customize the “Not Before” value.

                Unlike the `Validity` parameter, the `ValidityNotBefore` parameter is optional.

                The `ValidityNotBefore` value is expressed as an explicit date and time, using the `Validity` type value `ABSOLUTE`. For more information, see [Validity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_Validity.html) in this API reference and [Validity](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5) in RFC 5280.

            List all permissions on a private CA, if any, granted to the Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

            These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same Amazon Web Services account as the CA.

            Permissions can be granted with the [CreatePermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePermission.html) action and revoked with the [DeletePermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePermission.html) action.

            **About Permissions**

            - If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use `CreatePermission` to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.
            - For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.
            - If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html).

            Revokes a certificate that was issued inside Amazon Web Services Private CA. If you enable a certificate revocation list (CRL) when you create or update your private CA, information about the revoked certificates will be included in the CRL. Amazon Web Services Private CA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is revoked. If for any reason the CRL update fails, Amazon Web Services Private CA attempts makes further attempts every 15 minutes. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can create alarms for the metrics `CRLGenerated` and `MisconfiguredCRLBucket`. For more information, see [Supported CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaCloudWatch.html).

            Both Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see [Access policies for CRLs in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html#s3-policies).

                The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.

                - A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain only the `Enabled=False` parameter, and will fail if other parameters such as `CustomCname` or `ExpirationInDays` are included.
                - In a CRL configuration, the `S3BucketName` parameter must conform to [Amazon S3 bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
                - A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) parameter for CRLs or OCSP must conform to [RFC2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt) restrictions on the use of special characters in a CNAME.
                - In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                If you update the `S3BucketName` of [CrlConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html), you can break revocation for existing certificates. In other words, if you call [UpdateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html) to update the CRL configuration's S3 bucket name, Amazon Web Services Private CA only writes CRLs to the new S3 bucket. Certificates issued prior to this point will have the old S3 bucket name in your CRL Distribution Point (CDP) extension, essentially breaking revocation. If you must update the S3 bucket, you'll need to reissue old certificates to keep the revocation working. Alternatively, you can use a [CustomCname](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html#privateca-Type-CrlConfiguration-CustomCname) in your CRL configuration if you might need to change the S3 bucket name in the future.

            To save the audit report to your designated Amazon S3 bucket, you must create a bucket policy that grants Amazon Web Services Private CA permission to access and write to it. For an example policy, see [Prepare an Amazon S3 bucket for audit reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaAuditReport.html#s3-access).

            Amazon Web Services Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see [Encrypting Your Audit Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaAuditReport.html#audit-report-encryption).
