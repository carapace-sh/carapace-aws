            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of objects that you want to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, a `NextToken` value, which you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects, is provided.

                If you don't specify a value for `MaxResults`, up to 100 objects are returned.

                For the first call to this list request, omit this value.

                When you request a list of objects, at most the number of objects specified by `MaxResults` is returned. If more objects are available for retrieval, a `NextToken` value is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
