        flag:
            access-role: |-
                Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use.

                **For AS2 connectors**

                With AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths`. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for `--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt`, parent directory is `/bucket/dir/`) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the `AccessRole` needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with `StartFileTransfer`.

                If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission for that key.

                **For SFTP connectors**

                Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to Secrets Manager.

            You can import both the certificate and its chain in the `Certificate` parameter.

            After importing a certificate, Transfer Family automatically creates a Amazon CloudWatch metric called `DaysUntilExpiry` that tracks the number of days until the certificate expires. The metric is based on the `InactiveDate` parameter and is published daily in the `AWS/Transfer` namespace.

            It can take up to a full day after importing a certificate for Transfer Family to emit the `DaysUntilExpiry` metric to your account.

            If you use the `Certificate` parameter to upload both the certificate and its chain, don't use the `CertificateChain` parameter.

                Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use.

                **For AS2 connectors**

                With AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths`. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for `--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt`, parent directory is `/bucket/dir/`) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the `AccessRole` needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with `StartFileTransfer`.

                If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission for that key.

                **For SFTP connectors**

                Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to Secrets Manager.

                The domain of the storage system that is used for file transfers. There are two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). The default value is S3.

                After the server is created, the domain cannot be changed.
            endpoint-details: The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
            endpoint-type: |-
                The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

                After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`.

                For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

                It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to `VPC_ENDPOINT`.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            host-key: |-
                The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled server. You can add multiple host keys, in case you want to rotate keys, or have a set of active keys that use different algorithms.

                Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no passphrase:

                `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`.

                Use a minimum value of 2048 for the `-b` option. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or 4096.

                Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase:

                `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`.

                Valid values for the `-b` option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521.

                Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase:

                `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key`.

                For all of these commands, you can replace *my-new-server-key* with a string of your choice.

                If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

                For more information, see [Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key) in the *Transfer Family User Guide*.
            identity-provider-details: Required when `IdentityProviderType` is set to `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `Amazon Web Services_LAMBDA` or `API_GATEWAY`. Accepts an array containing all of the information required to use a directory in `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or invoke a customer-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL. Cannot be specified when `IdentityProviderType` is set to `SERVICE_MANAGED`.
            identity-provider-type: |-
                The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer Family service.

                Use `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` to provide access to Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.

                Use the `API_GATEWAY` value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The `API_GATEWAY` setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.

                Use the `AWS_LAMBDA` value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the `Function` parameter for the `IdentityProviderDetails` data type.
            ip-address-type: |-
                Specifies whether to use IPv4 only, or to use dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) for your Transfer Family endpoint. The default value is `IPV4`.

                The `IpAddressType` parameter has the following limitations:

                - It cannot be changed while the server is online. You must stop the server before modifying this parameter.
                - It cannot be updated to `DUALSTACK` if the server has `AddressAllocationIds` specified.

                When using `DUALSTACK` as the `IpAddressType`, you cannot set the `AddressAllocationIds` parameter for the [EndpointDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/APIReference/API_EndpointDetails.html) for the server.
            logging-role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
            post-authentication-login-banner: |-
                Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates.

                The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.
            pre-authentication-login-banner: |-
                Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following banner displays details about using the system:

                `This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.`
            protocol-details: |-
                The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

                Avoid placing Network Load Balancers (NLBs) or NAT gateways in front of Transfer Family servers, as this increases costs and can cause performance issues, including reduced connection limits for FTPS. For more details, see [Avoid placing NLBs and NATs in front of Transfer Family](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/infrastructure-security.html#nlb-considerations).

                - To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the `PassiveIp` parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.
                - To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the `SETSTAT` command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the `SetStatOption` parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the `SETSTAT` command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to `ENABLE_NO_OP`. If you set the `SetStatOption` parameter to `ENABLE_NO_OP`, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a `SETSTAT` call.
                - To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the `TlsSessionResumptionMode` parameter.
                - `As2Transports` indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently, only HTTP is supported.
            protocols: |-
                Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:

                - `SFTP` (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH
                - `FTPS` (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption
                - `FTP` (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer
                - `AS2` (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business data

                <!--THE END-->

                - If you select `FTPS`, you must choose a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.
                - If `Protocol` includes either `FTP` or `FTPS`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC` and the `IdentityProviderType` must be either `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, or `API_GATEWAY`.
                - If `Protocol` includes `FTP`, then `AddressAllocationIds` cannot be associated.
                - If `Protocol` is set only to `SFTP`, the `EndpointType` can be set to `PUBLIC` and the `IdentityProviderType` can be set any of the supported identity types: `SERVICE_MANAGED`, `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, or `API_GATEWAY`.
                - If `Protocol` includes `AS2`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC`, and domain must be Amazon S3.
            s3-storage-options: |-
                Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is optimized.

                - If using the console, this is enabled by default.
                - If using the API or CLI, this is disabled by default.

                By default, home directory mappings have a `TYPE` of `DIRECTORY`. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the `HomeDirectoryMapEntry` `Type` to `FILE` if you want a mapping to have a file target.
            security-policy-name: Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.
            structured-log-destinations: |-
                Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent.

                To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:

                `arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*`

                For example, `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*`

                If you have previously specified a log group for a server, you can clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an empty value for this parameter in an `update-server` call. For example:

                `update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations`
            tags: Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.
            workflow-details: |-
                Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution role that's used for executing the workflow.

                In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely, `WorkflowDetails` can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded.

                Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use.

                **For AS2 connectors**

                With AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths`. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for `--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt`, parent directory is `/bucket/dir/`) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the `AccessRole` needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with `StartFileTransfer`.

                If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission for that key.

                **For SFTP connectors**

                Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to Secrets Manager.

                The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.

                A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.

                You can use the `HomeDirectory` parameter for `HomeDirectoryType` when it is set to either `PATH` or `LOGICAL`.
            home-directory-mappings: |-
                Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in `Target`. This value can be set only when `HomeDirectoryType` is set to *LOGICAL*.

                The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.

                `[ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]`

                In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set `Target` to the `HomeDirectory` parameter value.

                The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.

                `[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]`
            home-directory-type: |-
                The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

                If `HomeDirectoryType` is `LOGICAL`, you must provide mappings, using the `HomeDirectoryMappings` parameter. If, on the other hand, `HomeDirectoryType` is `PATH`, you provide an absolute path using the `HomeDirectory` parameter. You cannot have both `HomeDirectory` and `HomeDirectoryMappings` in your template.
            policy: |-
                A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`, and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`.

                This policy applies only when the domain of `ServerId` is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.

                For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the `Policy` argument.

                For an example of a session policy, see [Example session policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy.html).

                Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use.

                **For AS2 connectors**

                With AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths`. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for `--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt`, parent directory is `/bucket/dir/`) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the `AccessRole` needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with `StartFileTransfer`.

                If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission for that key.

                **For SFTP connectors**

                Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to Secrets Manager.

                A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.

                You can use the `HomeDirectory` parameter for `HomeDirectoryType` when it is set to either `PATH` or `LOGICAL`.
            home-directory-mappings: |-
                Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in `Target`. This value can be set only when `HomeDirectoryType` is set to *LOGICAL*.

                The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.

                `[ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]`

                In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set `Target` to the `HomeDirectory` parameter value.

                The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.

                `[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]`

                The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

                If `HomeDirectoryType` is `LOGICAL`, you must provide mappings, using the `HomeDirectoryMappings` parameter. If, on the other hand, `HomeDirectoryType` is `PATH`, you provide an absolute path using the `HomeDirectory` parameter. You cannot have both `HomeDirectory` and `HomeDirectoryMappings` in your template.
            policy: |-
                A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`, and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`.

                This policy applies only when the domain of `ServerId` is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.

                For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the `Policy` argument.

                For an example of a session policy, see [Example session policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy.html).

            Changes the state of a file transfer protocol-enabled server from `ONLINE` to `OFFLINE`. An `OFFLINE` server cannot accept and process file transfer jobs. Information tied to your server, such as server and user properties, are not affected by stopping your server.

            Stopping the server does not reduce or impact your file transfer protocol endpoint billing; you must delete the server to stop being billed.

            The state of `STOPPING` indicates that the server is in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The values of `STOP_FAILED` can indicate an error condition.

                This returns details for the first 10 executions, as well as the pointer (`NextToken`) to the eleventh execution. You can now call the API again, supplying the `NextToken` value you received:

                `aws transfer list-executions --max-results 10 --next-token $somePointerReturnedFromPreviousListResult`

                This call returns the next 10 executions, the 11th through the 20th. You can then repeat the call until the details for all 100 executions have been returned.

        command: |-
            Retrieves a list of the contents of a directory from a remote SFTP server. You specify the connector ID, the output path, and the remote directory path. You can also specify the optional `MaxItems` value to control the maximum number of items that are listed from the remote directory. This API returns a list of all files and directories in the remote directory (up to the maximum value), but does not return files or folders in sub-directories. That is, it only returns a list of files and directories one-level deep.

            After you receive the listing file, you can provide the files that you want to transfer to the `RetrieveFilePaths` parameter of the `StartFileTransfer` API call.

            The naming convention for the output file is `connector-ID-listing-ID.json`. The output file contains the following information:

            - `filePath`: the complete path of a remote file, relative to the directory of the listing request for your SFTP connector on the remote server.
            - `modifiedTimestamp`: the last time the file was modified, in UTC time format. This field is optional. If the remote file attributes don't contain a timestamp, it is omitted from the file listing.
            - `size`: the size of the file, in bytes. This field is optional. If the remote file attributes don't contain a file size, it is omitted from the file listing.
            - `path`: the complete path of a remote directory, relative to the directory of the listing request for your SFTP connector on the remote server.
            - `truncated`: a flag indicating whether the list output contains all of the items contained in the remote directory or not. If your `Truncated` output value is true, you can increase the value provided in the optional `max-items` input attribute to be able to list more items (up to the maximum allowed list size of 10,000 items).

            The response returns the `ServerId` and the `UserName` for the updated user.

            In the console, you can select *Restricted* when you create or update a user. This ensures that the user can't access anything outside of their home directory. The programmatic way to configure this behavior is to update the user. Set their `HomeDirectoryType` to `LOGICAL`, and specify `HomeDirectoryMappings` with `Entry` as root (`/`) and `Target` as their home directory.

            For example, if the user's home directory is `/test/admin-user`, the following command updates the user so that their configuration in the console shows the *Restricted* flag as selected.

            `aws transfer update-user --server-id <server-id> --user-name admin-user --home-directory-type LOGICAL --home-directory-mappings "[{\"Entry\":\"/\", \"Target\":\"/test/admin-user\"}]"`

                A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.

                Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in `Target`. This value can be set only when `HomeDirectoryType` is set to *LOGICAL*.

                The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.

                `[ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]`

                In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to '/' and set `Target` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

                The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.

If you set it to `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

                If `HomeDirectoryType` is `LOGICAL`, you must provide mappings, using the `HomeDirectoryMappings` parameter. If, on the other hand, `HomeDirectoryType` is `PATH`, you provide an absolute path using the `HomeDirectory` parameter. You cannot have both `HomeDirectory` and `HomeDirectoryMappings` in your template.
            policy: |-
                A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`, and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`.

                This policy applies only when the domain of `ServerId` is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.

                For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the `Policy` argument.

                For an example of a session policy, see [Creating a session policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy).

            endpoint-details: The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
            endpoint-type: |-
                The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

                After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`.

                For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

                It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to `VPC_ENDPOINT`.

            host-key: |-
                The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled server. You can add multiple host keys, in case you want to rotate keys, or have a set of active keys that use different algorithms.

                Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no passphrase:

                `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`.

                Use a minimum value of 2048 for the `-b` option. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or 4096.

                Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase:

                `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`.

                Valid values for the `-b` option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521.

                Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase:

                `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key`.

                For all of these commands, you can replace *my-new-server-key* with a string of your choice.

                If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

                For more information, see [Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key) in the *Transfer Family User Guide*.
            identity-provider-details: An array containing all of the information required to call a customer's authentication API method.
            identity-provider-type: |-
                The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer Family service.

                Use `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` to provide access to Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.

                Use the `API_GATEWAY` value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The `API_GATEWAY` setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.

                Use the `AWS_LAMBDA` value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the `Function` parameter for the `IdentityProviderDetails` data type.
            ip-address-type: |-
                Specifies whether to use IPv4 only, or to use dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) for your Transfer Family endpoint. The default value is `IPV4`.

                The `IpAddressType` parameter has the following limitations:

                - It cannot be changed while the server is online. You must stop the server before modifying this parameter.
                - It cannot be updated to `DUALSTACK` if the server has `AddressAllocationIds` specified.

                When using `DUALSTACK` as the `IpAddressType`, you cannot set the `AddressAllocationIds` parameter for the [EndpointDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/APIReference/API_EndpointDetails.html) for the server.
            logging-role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
            post-authentication-login-banner: |-
                Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates.

                The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.
            pre-authentication-login-banner: |-
                Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following banner displays details about using the system:

                `This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.`
            protocol-details: |-
                The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

                Avoid placing Network Load Balancers (NLBs) or NAT gateways in front of Transfer Family servers, as this increases costs and can cause performance issues, including reduced connection limits for FTPS. For more details, see [Avoid placing NLBs and NATs in front of Transfer Family](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/infrastructure-security.html#nlb-considerations).

                - To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the `PassiveIp` parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.
                - To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the `SETSTAT` command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the `SetStatOption` parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the `SETSTAT` command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to `ENABLE_NO_OP`. If you set the `SetStatOption` parameter to `ENABLE_NO_OP`, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a `SETSTAT` call.
                - To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the `TlsSessionResumptionMode` parameter.
                - `As2Transports` indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently, only HTTP is supported.
            protocols: |-
                Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:

                - `SFTP` (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH
                - `FTPS` (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption
                - `FTP` (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer
                - `AS2` (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business data

                <!--THE END-->

                - If you select `FTPS`, you must choose a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.
                - If `Protocol` includes either `FTP` or `FTPS`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC` and the `IdentityProviderType` must be either `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, or `API_GATEWAY`.
                - If `Protocol` includes `FTP`, then `AddressAllocationIds` cannot be associated.
                - If `Protocol` is set only to `SFTP`, the `EndpointType` can be set to `PUBLIC` and the `IdentityProviderType` can be set any of the supported identity types: `SERVICE_MANAGED`, `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, or `API_GATEWAY`.
                - If `Protocol` includes `AS2`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC`, and domain must be Amazon S3.
            s3-storage-options: |-
                Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is optimized.

                - If using the console, this is enabled by default.
                - If using the API or CLI, this is disabled by default.

                By default, home directory mappings have a `TYPE` of `DIRECTORY`. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the `HomeDirectoryMapEntry` `Type` to `FILE` if you want a mapping to have a file target.
            security-policy-name: Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.
            server-id: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance that the Transfer Family user is assigned to.
            structured-log-destinations: |-
                Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent.

                To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:

                `arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*`

                For example, `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*`

                If you have previously specified a log group for a server, you can clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an empty value for this parameter in an `update-server` call. For example:

                `update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations`
            workflow-details: |-
                Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution role that's used for executing the workflow.

                In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely, `WorkflowDetails` can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded.

                To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can provide an empty `OnUpload` object, as in the following example.

                `aws transfer update-server --server-id s-01234567890abcdef --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'`

    command: Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS. Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
