            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

    command: Amazon Web Services Outposts is a fully managed service that extends Amazon Web Services infrastructure, APIs, and tools to customer premises. By providing local access to Amazon Web Services managed infrastructure, Amazon Web Services Outposts enables customers to build and run applications on premises using the same programming interfaces as in Amazon Web Services Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for lower latency and local data processing needs.
