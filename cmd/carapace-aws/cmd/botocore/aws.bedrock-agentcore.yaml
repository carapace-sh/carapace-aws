            Retrieves detailed information about a specific browser session in Amazon Bedrock. This operation returns the session's configuration, current status, associated streams, and metadata.

            To get a browser session, you must specify both the browser identifier and the session ID. The response includes information about the session's viewport configuration, timeout settings, and stream endpoints.

            Sends a request to an agent or tool hosted in an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and receives responses in real-time.

            To invoke an agent you must specify the AgentCore Runtime ARN and provide a payload containing your request. You can optionally specify a qualifier to target a specific version or endpoint of the agent.

            This operation supports streaming responses, allowing you to receive partial responses as they become available. We recommend using pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully when processing large responses.

            For example code, see [Invoke an AgentCore Runtime agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-invoke-agent.html).

            If you're integrating your agent with OAuth, you can't use the Amazon Web Services SDK to call `InvokeAgentRuntime`. Instead, make a HTTPS request to `InvokeAgentRuntime`. For an example, see [Authenticate and authorize with Inbound Auth and Outbound Auth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-oauth.html).

            To use this operation, you must have the `bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime` permission. If you are making a call to `InvokeAgentRuntime` on behalf of a user ID with the `X-Amzn-Bedrock-AgentCore-Runtime-User-Id` header, You require permissions to both actions (`bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime` and `bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntimeForUser`).
