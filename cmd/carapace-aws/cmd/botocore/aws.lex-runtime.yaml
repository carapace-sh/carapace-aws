      documentation:
        command: "Sends user input (text or speech) to Amazon Lex. Clients use this API to send text and audio requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the user input using the machine learning model that it built for the bot.\n\nThe `PostContent` operation supports audio input at 8kHz and 16kHz. You can use 8kHz audio to achieve higher speech recognition accuracy in telephone audio applications.\n\nIn response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following example messages:\n\n- For a user input \"I would like a pizza,\" Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data (for example, `PizzaSize`): \"What size pizza would you like?\".\n- After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message to get user confirmation: \"Order the pizza?\".\n- After the user replies \"Yes\" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: \"Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.\".\n\nNot all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion statements do not require a response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the `message`, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate client user interface. Consider the following examples:\n\n- If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context information:\n  \n  - `x-amz-lex-dialog-state` header set to `ElicitSlot`\n  - `x-amz-lex-intent-name` header set to the intent name in the current context\n  - `x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit` header set to the slot name for which the `message` is eliciting information\n  - `x-amz-lex-slots` header set to a map of slots configured for the intent with their current values\n- If the message is a confirmation prompt, the `x-amz-lex-dialog-state` header is set to `Confirmation` and the `x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit` header is omitted.\n- If the message is a clarification prompt configured for the intent, indicating that the user intent is not understood, the `x-amz-dialog-state` header is set to `ElicitIntent` and the `x-amz-slot-to-elicit` header is omitted.\n\nIn addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific `sessionAttributes`. For more information, see [Managing Conversation Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/context-mgmt.html)."

Amazon Lex uses Amazon Polly to generate the speech (using the configuration you specified in the `Accept` header). For example, if you specify `audio/mpeg` as the value, Amazon Lex returns speech in the MPEG format.\n- If the value is `audio/pcm`, the speech returned is `audio/pcm` in 16-bit, little endian format.\n- The following are the accepted values:\n  \n  - audio/mpeg\n  - audio/ogg\n  - audio/pcm\n  - text/plain; charset=utf-8\n  - audio/* (defaults to mpeg)"

                User input in PCM or Opus audio format or text format as described in the `Content-Type` HTTP header.

                You can stream audio data to Amazon Lex or you can create a local buffer that captures all of the audio data before sending. In general, you get better performance if you stream audio data rather than buffering the data locally.
            request-attributes: |-
                You pass this value as the `x-amz-lex-request-attributes` HTTP header.

                Request-specific information passed between Amazon Lex and a client application. The value must be a JSON serialized and base64 encoded map with string keys and values. The total size of the `requestAttributes` and `sessionAttributes` headers is limited to 12 KB.

                The namespace `x-amz-lex:` is reserved for special attributes. Don't create any request attributes with the prefix `x-amz-lex:`.

                For more information, see [Setting Request Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/context-mgmt.html#context-mgmt-request-attribs).

            user-id: |-
                The ID of the client application user. Amazon Lex uses this to identify a user's conversation with your bot. At runtime, each request must contain the `userID` field.

                To decide the user ID to use for your application, consider the following factors.

                - The `userID` field must not contain any personally identifiable information of the user, for example, name, personal identification numbers, or other end user personal information.
                - If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and continue on another device, use a user-specific identifier.
                - If you want the same user to be able to have two independent conversations on two different devices, choose a device-specific identifier.
                - A user can't have two independent conversations with two different versions of the same bot. For example, a user can't have a conversation with the PROD and BETA versions of the same bot. If you anticipate that a user will need to have conversation with two different versions, for example, while testing, include the bot alias in the user ID to separate the two conversations.

                A summary of the recent intents for the bot. You can use the intent summary view to set a checkpoint label on an intent and modify attributes of intents. You can also use it to remove or add intent summary objects to the list.

                An intent that you modify or add to the list must make sense for the bot. For example, the intent name must be valid for the bot. You must provide valid values for:

                - `intentName`
                - slot names
                - `slotToElict`

                If you send the `recentIntentSummaryView` parameter in a `PutSession` request, the contents of the new summary view replaces the old summary view. For example, if a `GetSession` request returns three intents in the summary view and you call `PutSession` with one intent in the summary view, the next call to `GetSession` will only return one intent.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
