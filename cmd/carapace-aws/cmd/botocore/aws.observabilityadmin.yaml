                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

            max-results: The maximum number of telemetry rules to return in a single call.
            next-token: The token for the next set of results. A previous call generates this token.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            rule-name-prefix: A string to filter telemetry rules whose names begin with the specified prefix.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

        You can use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Admin to discover and understand the state of telemetry configuration in CloudWatch for your Amazon Web Services Organization or account. This simplifies the process of auditing your telemetry collection configurations across multiple resource types within your Amazon Web Services Organization or account. By providing a consolidated view, it allows you to easily review and manage telemetry settings, helping you ensure proper monitoring and data collection across your Amazon Web Services environment. For more information, see [Auditing CloudWatch telemetry conﬁgurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/telemetry-config-cloudwatch.html) in the CloudWatch User Guide.

        For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [Identity and access management for Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/auth-and-access-control-cw.html) in the CloudWatch User Guide.
