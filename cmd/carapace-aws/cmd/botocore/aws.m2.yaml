Currently, Amazon Web Services Mainframe Modernization accepts the `engineVersion` parameter only if `applyDuringMaintenanceWindow` is true. If any parameter other than `engineVersion` is provided in `UpdateEnvironmentRequest`, it will fail if `applyDuringMaintenanceWindow` is set to true.

                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of objects to return.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
