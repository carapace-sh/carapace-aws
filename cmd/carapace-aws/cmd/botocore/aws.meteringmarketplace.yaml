            The `CustomerIdentifier` parameter is scheduled for deprecation on March 31, 2026. Use `CustomerAWSAccountID` instead.

            These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can't specify both `CustomerIdentifier` and `CustomerAWSAccountID` in the same request.

            To post metering records for customers, SaaS applications call `BatchMeterUsage`, which is used for metering SaaS flexible consumption pricing (FCP). Identical requests are idempotent and can be retried with the same records or a subset of records. Each `BatchMeterUsage` request is for only one product. If you want to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple `BatchMeterUsage` calls.

            Usage records should be submitted in quick succession following a recorded event. Usage records aren't accepted 6 hours or more after an event.

            `BatchMeterUsage` can process up to 25 `UsageRecords` at a time, and each request must be less than 1 MB in size. Optionally, you can have multiple usage allocations for usage data that's split into buckets according to predefined tags.

            `BatchMeterUsage` returns a list of `UsageRecordResult` objects, which have each `UsageRecord`. It also returns a list of `UnprocessedRecords`, which indicate errors on the service side that should be retried.

            For Amazon Web Services Regions that support `BatchMeterUsage`, see [BatchMeterUsage Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#batchmeterusage-region-support).

            For an example of `BatchMeterUsage`, see [BatchMeterUsage code example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-code-examples.html#saas-batchmeterusage-example) in the *Amazon Web Services Marketplace Seller Guide*.

            API to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is idempotent and returns the metering record ID. This is used for metering flexible consumption pricing (FCP) Amazon Machine Images (AMI) and container products.

            `MeterUsage` is authenticated on the buyer's Amazon Web Services account using credentials from the Amazon EC2 instance, Amazon ECS task, or Amazon EKS pod.

            `MeterUsage` can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide customers with usage data split into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to define).

            Submit usage records to report events from the previous hour. If you submit records that are greater than six hours after events occur, the records won’t be accepted. The timestamp in your request determines when an event is recorded. You can only report usage once per hour for each dimension. For AMI-based products, this is per dimension and per EC2 instance. For container products, this is per dimension and per ECS task or EKS pod. You can’t modify values after they’re recorded. If you report usage before the current hour ends, you will be unable to report additional usage until the next hour begins.

            For Amazon Web Services Regions that support `MeterUsage`, see [MeterUsage Region support for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#meterusage-region-support-ec2) and [MeterUsage Region support for Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#meterusage-region-support-ecs-eks).

                Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

        command: "Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services Marketplace must integrate with the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service and call the `RegisterUsage` operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call `RegisterUsage`, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of `RegisterUsage`. `RegisterUsage` performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.\n\n- *Entitlement*: `RegisterUsage` allows you to verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on Amazon Web Services Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that integrates with `RegisterUsage` is only required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a `CustomerNotSubscribedException` or `PlatformNotSupportedException` will only be thrown on the initial call to `RegisterUsage`. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a `CustomerNotSubscribedException`, even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.\n- *Metering*: `RegisterUsage` meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged for 10 tasks. Software metering is handled by the Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane—your software is not required to perform metering-specific actions other than to call `RegisterUsage` to commence metering. The Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane will also bill customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customer's subscription state, which removes the need for your software to run entitlement checks at runtime. For containers, `RegisterUsage` should be called immediately at launch. If you don’t register the container within the first 6 hours of the launch, Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service doesn’t provide any metering guarantees for previous months. Metering will continue, however, for the current month forward until the container ends. `RegisterUsage` is for metering paid hourly container products.\n  \n  For Amazon Web Services Regions that support `RegisterUsage`, see [RegisterUsage Region support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#registerusage-region-support)."

            `ResolveCustomer` is called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a registration token through their browser. The registration token is resolved through this API to obtain a `CustomerIdentifier` along with the `CustomerAWSAccountId` and `ProductCode`.

            To successfully resolve the token, the API must be called from the account that was used to publish the SaaS application. For an example of using `ResolveCustomer`, see [ResolveCustomer code example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-code-examples.html#saas-resolvecustomer-example) in the *Amazon Web Services Marketplace Seller Guide*.

            Permission is required for this operation. Your IAM role or user performing this operation requires a policy to allow the `aws-marketplace:ResolveCustomer` action.
