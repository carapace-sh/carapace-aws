    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided
    --cluster-mode=: Enabled or Disabled.
    --engine-version=: The upgraded version of the cache engine to be run on the clusters in the replication group.
    --engine=: Modifies the engine listed in a replication group message.
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request
    --ip-discovery=: The network type you choose when modifying a cluster, either `ipv4` | `ipv6`.
    --log-delivery-configurations=: Specifies the destination, format and type of the logs.
    --multi-az-enabled=: A flag to indicate MultiAZ is enabled.
    --no-apply-immediately: If `true`, this parameter causes the modifications in this request and any pending modifications to be applied, asynchronously and as soon as possible, regardless of the `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` setting for the replication group.
    --node-group-id=: Deprecated.
    --notification-topic-arn=: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications are sent.
    --notification-topic-status=: The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic for the replication group.
    --preferred-maintenance-window=: Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed.
    --primary-cluster-id=: For replication groups with a single primary, if this parameter is specified, ElastiCache promotes the specified cluster in the specified replication group to the primary role.
    --remove-user-groups=: Removes the user group associated with this replication group.
    --replication-group-description=: A description for the replication group.
    --replication-group-id=!: The identifier of the replication group to modify.
    --security-group-ids=: Specifies the VPC Security Groups associated with the clusters in the replication group.
    --snapshot-retention-limit=: The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic node group (shard) snapshots before deleting them.
    --snapshot-window=: The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of the node group (shard) specified by `SnapshottingClusterId`.
    --snapshotting-cluster-id=: The cluster ID that is used as the daily snapshot source for the replication group.
    --transit-encryption-enabled=: A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.
    --transit-encryption-mode=: A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime.
    --user-group-ids-to-add=: The ID of the user group you are associating with the replication group.
    --user-group-ids-to-remove=: The ID of the user group to disassociate from the replication group, meaning the users in the group no longer can access the replication group.
