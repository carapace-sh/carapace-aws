            max-results: The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use `NextToken` to obtain more pages of results. The default is 100; the maximum allowed page size is also 100.
            next-token: If `NextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `NextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

        command: Opts out a speaker from Voice ID. A speaker can be opted out regardless of whether or not they already exist in Voice ID. If they don't yet exist, a new speaker is created in an opted out state. If they already exist, their existing status is overridden and they are opted out. Enrollment and evaluation authentication requests are rejected for opted out speakers, and opted out speakers have no voice embeddings stored in Voice ID.
