description: 'End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs).'
flags:
    --acl=: The canned ACL to apply to the object.
    --bucket-key-enabled=: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).
    --bucket=!: The name of the bucket where the multipart upload is initiated and where the object is uploaded.
    --cache-control=: Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
    --checksum-algorithm=: Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum for the object.
    --checksum-type=: Indicates the checksum type that you want Amazon S3 to use to calculate the object’s checksum value.
    --content-disposition=: Specifies presentational information for the object.
    --content-encoding=: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.
    --content-language=: The language that the content is in.
    --content-type=: A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
    --expected-bucket-owner=: The account ID of the expected bucket owner.
    --expires=: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
    --grant-full-control=: Specify access permissions explicitly to give the grantee READ, READ\_ACP, and WRITE\_ACP permissions on the object.
    --grant-read-acp=: Specify access permissions explicitly to allows grantee to read the object ACL.
    --grant-read=: Specify access permissions explicitly to allow grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
    --grant-write-acp=: Specify access permissions explicitly to allows grantee to allow grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
    --key=!: Object key for which the multipart upload is to be initiated.
    --metadata=: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
    --object-lock-legal-hold-status=: Specifies whether you want to apply a legal hold to the uploaded object.
    --object-lock-mode=: Specifies the Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the uploaded object.
    --object-lock-retain-until-date=: Specifies the date and time when you want the Object Lock to expire.
    --request-payer=: ""
    --server-side-encryption=: The server-side encryption algorithm used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.
    --sse-customer-algorithm=: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
    --sse-customer-key-m-d5=: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    --sse-customer-key=: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
    --ssekms-encryption-context=: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
    --ssekms-key-id=: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption.
    --storage-class=: By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects.
    --tagging=: The tag-set for the object.
    --website-redirect-location=: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
