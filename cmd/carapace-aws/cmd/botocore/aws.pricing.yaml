        command: Returns the metadata for one service or a list of the metadata for all services. Use this without a service code to get the service codes for all services. Use it with a service code, such as `AmazonEC2`, to get information specific to that service, such as the attribute names available for that service. For example, some of the attribute names available for EC2 are `volumeType`, `maxIopsVolume`, `operation`, `locationType`, and `instanceCapacity10xlarge`.
