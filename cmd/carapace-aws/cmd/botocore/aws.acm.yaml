            Imports a certificate into Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with services that are integrated with ACM. Note that [integrated services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html) allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see [Importing Certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) in the *Certificate Manager User Guide*.

            ACM does not provide [managed renewal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html) for certificates that you import.

            Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:

            - You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.
            - The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.
            - The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).
            - The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.
            - The current time must be between the `Not Before` and `Not After` certificate fields.
            - The `Issuer` field must not be empty.
            - The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.
            - To import a new certificate, omit the `CertificateArn` argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.
            - When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by `fileb://`. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the `C:\temp` folder as `fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem`. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.
            - When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using.
            - The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.

            This operation returns the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the imported certificate.
        flag:

            Adds one or more tags to an ACM certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Each tag consists of a `key` and an optional `value`. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair.

            You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information, see [Tagging ACM certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/tags.html).

            To remove one or more tags, use the [RemoveTagsFromCertificate]() action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the [ListTagsForCertificate]() action.

        command: |-
            Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the `DomainName` parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the `SubjectAlternativeNames` parameter.

            If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required. If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use [DNS validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html) or [email validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html). We recommend that you use DNS validation.

            ACM behavior differs from the [RFC 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2) specification of the certificate validation process. ACM first checks for a Subject Alternative Name, and, if it finds one, ignores the common name (CN).

            After successful completion of the `RequestCertificate` action, there is a delay of several seconds before you can retrieve information about the new certificate.
        flag:
            certificate-authority-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private certificate authority (CA) that will be used to issue the certificate. If you do not provide an ARN and you are trying to request a private certificate, ACM will attempt to issue a public certificate. For more information about private CAs, see the [Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) user guide. The ARN must have the following form:

                `arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            domain-name: |-
                Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com, that you want to secure with an ACM certificate. Use an asterisk (\*) to create a wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the same domain. For example, \*.example.com protects www.example.com, site.example.com, and images.example.com.

                In compliance with [RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), the length of the domain name (technically, the Common Name) that you provide cannot exceed 64 octets (characters), including periods. To add a longer domain name, specify it in the Subject Alternative Name field, which supports names up to 253 octets in length.
            domain-validation-options: The domain name that you want ACM to use to send you emails so that you can validate domain ownership.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            idempotency-token: Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to `RequestCertificate`. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call `RequestCertificate` multiple times with the same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.
            key-algorithm: |-
                Specifies the algorithm of the public and private key pair that your certificate uses to encrypt data. RSA is the default key algorithm for ACM certificates. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys are smaller, offering security comparable to RSA keys but with greater computing efficiency. However, ECDSA is not supported by all network clients. Some Amazon Web Services services may require RSA keys, or only support ECDSA keys of a particular size, while others allow the use of either RSA and ECDSA keys to ensure that compatibility is not broken. Check the requirements for the Amazon Web Services service where you plan to deploy your certificate. For more information about selecting an algorithm, see [Key algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-certificate.html#algorithms).

                Algorithms supported for an ACM certificate request include:

                - `RSA_2048`
                - `EC_prime256v1`
                - `EC_secp384r1`

                Other listed algorithms are for imported certificates only.

                When you request a private PKI certificate signed by a CA from Amazon Web Services Private CA, the specified signing algorithm family (RSA or ECDSA) must match the algorithm family of the CA's secret key.

                Default: RSA\_2048
            managed-by: Identifies the Amazon Web Services service that manages the certificate issued by ACM.
            options: |-
                You can use this parameter to specify whether to add the certificate to a certificate transparency log and export your certificate.

                Certificate transparency makes it possible to detect SSL/TLS certificates that have been mistakenly or maliciously issued. Certificates that have not been logged typically produce an error message in a browser. For more information, see [Opting Out of Certificate Transparency Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-bestpractices.html#best-practices-transparency).

                You can export public ACM certificates to use with Amazon Web Services services as well as outside the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For more information, see [Certificate Manager exportable public certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-exportable-certificates.html).
            subject-alternative-names: |-
                Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the ACM certificate. For example, add the name www.example.net to a certificate for which the `DomainName` field is www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more information, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html).

                The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer than 63 octets. Consider the following examples:

                - `(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)` is legal because the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label exceeds 63 octets.
                - `(64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)` is not legal because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61) and the first label exceeds 63 octets.
                - `(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(62 octets)` is not legal because the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62) exceeds 253 octets.
            tags: One or more resource tags to associate with the certificate.
            validation-method: The method you want to use if you are requesting a public certificate to validate that you own or control domain. You can [validate with DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html) or [validate with email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html). We recommend that you use DNS validation.

      documentation:
        command: Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation. The domain owner or an authorized representative must approve the ACM certificate before it can be issued. The certificate can be approved by clicking a link in the mail to navigate to the Amazon certificate approval website and then clicking **I Approve**. However, the validation email can be blocked by spam filters. Therefore, if you do not receive the original mail, you can request that the mail be resent within 72 hours of requesting the ACM certificate. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since your original request or since your last attempt to resend validation mail, you must request a new certificate.
