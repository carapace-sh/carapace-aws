            Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create `MANAGED` or `UNMANAGED` compute environments. `MANAGED` compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. `UNMANAGED` compute environments can only use EC2 resources.

            In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.

            In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see [container instance AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the [DescribeComputeEnvironments]() operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see [Launching an Amazon ECS container instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            Batch doesn't automatically upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's created. For more information on how to update a compute environment's AMI, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.

            compute-resources: Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see [Compute Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.
            context: Reserved.
            eks-configuration: |-
                The details for the Amazon EKS cluster that supports the compute environment.

                To create a compute environment that uses EKS resources, the caller must have permissions to call `eks:DescribeCluster`.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            service-role: |-
                The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see [Batch service IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.

                If your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to create the Batch service-linked role in your account.

                If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/`, specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see [Friendly names and paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the `service-role` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
            state: |-
                The state of the compute environment. If the state is `ENABLED`, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.

                If the state is `ENABLED`, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

                If the state is `DISABLED`, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the `DISABLED` state don't scale out.

                Compute environments in a `DISABLED` state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see [State](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environment_parameters.html#compute_environment_state) in the *Batch User Guide*.

                When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the `minvCpus` value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a `c5.8xlarge` instance with a `minvCpus` value of `4` and a `desiredvCpus` value of `36`. This instance doesn't scale down to a `c5.large` instance.
            tags: |-
                The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

                These tags can be updated or removed using the [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) and [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html) API operations. These tags don't propagate to the underlying compute resources.
            type: 'The type of the compute environment: `MANAGED` or `UNMANAGED`. For more information, see [Compute Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.'
            unmanagedv-cpus: |-
                The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair-share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair-share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.

                This parameter is only supported when the `type` parameter is set to `UNMANAGED`.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results that's returned by `ListSchedulingPolicies` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListSchedulingPolicies` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page and a `nextToken` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another `ListSchedulingPolicies` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, `ListSchedulingPolicies` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.

                The `nextToken` value that's returned from a previous paginated `ListSchedulingPolicies` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

                Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

            filters: |-
                The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, `jobStatus` is ignored. The results are sorted by the `createdAt` field, with the most recent jobs being first.

                JOB\_NAME

                The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (\*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the '\*'. This corresponds to the `jobName` value. For example, `test1` matches both `Test1` and `test1`, and `test1*` matches both `test1` and `Test10`. When the `JOB_NAME` filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.

                BEFORE\_CREATED\_AT

                The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

                AFTER\_CREATED\_AT

                The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results returned by `ListServiceJobs` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListServiceJobs` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page and a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListServiceJobs` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListServiceJobs` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListServiceJobs` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

                Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            job-queue-name: The name of the job queue. It can be up to 128 letters long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (\_).
            job-queue-type: The type of job queue. For service jobs that run on SageMaker Training, this value is `SAGEMAKER_TRAINING`. For regular container jobs, this value is `EKS`, `ECS`, or `ECS_FARGATE` depending on the compute environment.
            job-state-time-limit-actions: 'The set of actions that Batch performs on jobs that remain at the head of the job queue in the specified state longer than specified times. Batch will perform each action after `maxTimeSeconds` has passed. (**Note**: The minimum value for maxTimeSeconds is 600 (10 minutes) and its maximum value is 86,400 (24 hours).)'
            priority: The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the `priority` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of `10` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of `1`. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
            scheduling-policy-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair-share scheduling policy. Job queues that don't have a fair-share scheduling policy are scheduled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) model. After a job queue has a fair-share scheduling policy, it can be replaced but can't be removed.

                The format is `aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name`.

                An example is `aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy`.

                A job queue without a fair-share scheduling policy is scheduled as a FIFO job queue and can't have a fair-share scheduling policy added. Jobs queues with a fair-share scheduling policy can have a maximum of 500 active share identifiers. When the limit has been reached, submissions of any jobs that add a new share identifier fail.
            service-environment-order: A list of service environments that this job queue can use to allocate jobs. All serviceEnvironments must have the same type. A job queue can't have both a serviceEnvironmentOrder and a computeEnvironmentOrder field.
            state: The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is `ENABLED`, it is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is `DISABLED`, new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.
            tags: The tags that you apply to the job queue to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see [Tagging your Batch resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html) in *Batch User Guide*.

            consumable-resource-properties-override: An object that contains overrides for the consumable resources of a job.
            container-overrides: An object with properties that override the defaults for the job definition that specify the name of a container in the specified job definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the default command for a container, which is specified in the job definition or the Docker image, with a `command` override. You can also override existing environment variables on a container or add new environment variables to it with an `environment` override.
            depends-on: A list of dependencies for the job. A job can depend upon a maximum of 20 jobs. You can specify a `SEQUENTIAL` type dependency without specifying a job ID for array jobs so that each child array job completes sequentially, starting at index 0. You can also specify an `N_TO_N` type dependency with a job ID for array jobs. In that case, each index child of this job must wait for the corresponding index child of each dependency to complete before it can begin.
            ecs-properties-override: An object, with properties that override defaults for the job definition, can only be specified for jobs that are run on Amazon ECS resources.
            eks-properties-override: An object, with properties that override defaults for the job definition, can only be specified for jobs that are run on Amazon EKS resources.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            job-definition: |-
                The job definition used by this job. This value can be one of `definition-name`, `definition-name:revision`, or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job definition, with or without the revision (`arn:aws:batch:region:account:job-definition/definition-name:revision`, or `arn:aws:batch:region:account:job-definition/definition-name`).

                If the revision is not specified, then the latest active revision is used.
            job-name: The name of the job. It can be up to 128 letters long. The first character must be alphanumeric, can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (\_).
            job-queue: The job queue where the job is submitted. You can specify either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.
            node-overrides: |-
                A list of node overrides in JSON format that specify the node range to target and the container overrides for that node range.

                This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources; use `containerOverrides` instead.
            parameters: Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters are specified as a key and value pair mapping. Parameters in a `SubmitJob` request override any corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition.
            propagate-tags: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the `FAILED` state. When specified, this overrides the tag propagation setting in the job definition.
            retry-strategy: The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this [SubmitJob]() operation. When a retry strategy is specified here, it overrides the retry strategy defined in the job definition.
            scheduling-priority-override: |-
                The scheduling priority for the job. This only affects jobs in job queues with a fair-share policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling priority are scheduled before jobs with a lower scheduling priority. This overrides any scheduling priority in the job definition and works only within a single share identifier.

                The minimum supported value is 0 and the maximum supported value is 9999.
            share-identifier: |-
                The share identifier for the job. Don't specify this parameter if the job queue doesn't have a fair-share scheduling policy. If the job queue has a fair-share scheduling policy, then this parameter must be specified.

                This string is limited to 255 alphanumeric characters, and can be followed by an asterisk (\*).
            tags: The tags that you apply to the job request to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
            timeout: The timeout configuration for this [SubmitJob]() operation. You can specify a timeout duration after which Batch terminates your jobs if they haven't finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration specified in the job definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the same timeout configuration as the parent job. For more information, see [Job Timeouts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/job_timeouts.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results returned by `DescribeJobQueues` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeJobQueues` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page and a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeJobQueues` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `DescribeJobQueues` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.

                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `DescribeJobQueues` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

                Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

            filters: |-
                The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, `jobStatus` is ignored. The filter doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the `createdAt` field, with the most recent jobs being first.

                JOB\_NAME

                The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (\*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the '\*'. This corresponds to the `jobName` value. For example, `test1` matches both `Test1` and `test1`, and `test1*` matches both `test1` and `Test10`. When the `JOB_NAME` filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.

                JOB\_DEFINITION

                The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the `jobDefinition` value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (\*), the filter matches any job definition name that begins with the string before the '\*'. For example, `jd1` matches only `jd1`, and `jd1*` matches both `jd1` and `jd1A`. The version of the job definition that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the `JOB_DEFINITION` filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form `arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}`), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (\*) isn't supported when the ARN is used.

                BEFORE\_CREATED\_AT

                The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

                AFTER\_CREATED\_AT

                The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListJobs` request with the returned `nextToken` value.

                The following outlines key parameters and limitations:

                - The minimum value is 1.
                - When `--job-status` is used, Batch returns up to 1000 values.
                - When `--filters` is used, Batch returns up to 100 values.
                - If neither parameter is used, then `ListJobs` returns up to 1000 results (jobs that are in the `RUNNING` status) and a `nextToken` value, if applicable.
            multi-node-job-id: The job ID for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associated with the specified job.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListJobs` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

            max-results: The maximum number of results returned by `ListJobsByConsumableResource` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListJobsByConsumableResource` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page and a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListJobsByConsumableResource` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListJobsByConsumableResource` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListJobsByConsumableResource` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

                Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

For more information, see [Batch service IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.

                If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it can't be changed to use a regular IAM role. Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require an infrastructure update to change, the **AWSServiceRoleForBatch** service-linked role must be used. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.

                If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

                Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the `service-role` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
            state: |-
                The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the `ENABLED` state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues.

                If the state is `ENABLED`, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

                If the state is `DISABLED`, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the `DISABLED` state don't scale out.

                Compute environments in a `DISABLED` state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see [State](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environment_parameters.html#compute_environment_state) in the *Batch User Guide*.

                When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the `minvCpus` value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a `c5.8xlarge` instance with a `minvCpus` value of `4` and a `desiredvCpus` value of `36`. This instance doesn't scale down to a `c5.large` instance.
            unmanagedv-cpus: The maximum number of vCPUs expected to be used for an unmanaged compute environment. Don't specify this parameter for a managed compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair-share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair-share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.
            update-policy: Specifies the updated infrastructure update policy for the compute environment. For more information about infrastructure updates, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the *Batch User Guide*.

                Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the job scheduler to determine which compute environment runs a given job. Compute environments must be in the `VALID` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

                All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

Batch will perform each action after `maxTimeSeconds` has passed. (**Note**: The minimum value for maxTimeSeconds is 600 (10 minutes) and its maximum value is 86,400 (24 hours).)'
            priority: The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the `priority` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of `10` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of `1`. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
            scheduling-policy-arn: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair-share scheduling policy. Once a job queue is created, the fair-share scheduling policy can be replaced but not removed.

            state: Describes the queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is `ENABLED`, it can accept jobs. If the job queue state is `DISABLED`, new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

        Batch

        Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision resources, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly.

        As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and solving your specific problems instead.
