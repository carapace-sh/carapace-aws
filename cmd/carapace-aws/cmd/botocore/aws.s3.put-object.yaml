description: 'End of support notice: Beginning October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 will discontinue support for creating new Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACL).'
flags:
    --acl=: The canned ACL to apply to the object.
    --body=: Object data.
    --bucket-key-enabled=: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).
    --bucket=!: The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.
    --cache-control=: Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
    --checksum-algorithm=: Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK.
    --checksum-cr-c32-c=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-cr-c32=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-cr-c64-nvme=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-sh-a1=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-sh-a256=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided
    --content-disposition=: Specifies presentational information for the object.
    --content-encoding=: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.
    --content-language=: The language the content is in.
    --content-length=: Size of the body in bytes.
    --content-m-d5=: The Base64 encoded 128-bit `MD5` digest of the message (without the headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was originally sent.
    --content-type=: A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents.
    --expected-bucket-owner=: The account ID of the expected bucket owner.
    --expires=: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request
    --grant-full-control=: Gives the grantee READ, READ\_ACP, and WRITE\_ACP permissions on the object.
    --grant-read-acp=: Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
    --grant-read=: Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
    --grant-write-acp=: Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
    --if-match=: Uploads the object only if the ETag (entity tag) value provided during the WRITE operation matches the ETag of the object in S3.
    --if-none-match=: Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in the bucket specified.
    --key=!: Object key for which the PUT action was initiated.
    --metadata=: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
    --object-lock-legal-hold-status=: Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object.
    --object-lock-mode=: The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
    --object-lock-retain-until-date=: The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
    --request-payer=: ""
    --server-side-encryption=: The server-side encryption algorithm that was used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.
    --sse-customer-algorithm=: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, `AES256`).
    --sse-customer-key-m-d5=: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    --sse-customer-key=: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
    --ssekms-encryption-context=: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for object encryption.
    --ssekms-key-id=: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption.
    --storage-class=: By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects.
    --tagging=: The tag-set for the object.
    --website-redirect-location=: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
    --write-offset-bytes=: Specifies the offset for appending data to existing objects in bytes.
