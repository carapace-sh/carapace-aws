            Generates a report that lists all tagged resources in the accounts across your organization and tells whether each resource is compliant with the effective tag policy. Compliance data is refreshed daily. The report is generated asynchronously.

            The generated report is saved to the following location:

            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AwsTagPolicies/o-exampleorgid/YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ/report.csv`

            For more information about evaluating resource compliance with tag policies, including the required permissions, review [Permissions for evaluating organization-wide compliance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tag-policies-orgs.html#tag-policies-permissions-org) in the *Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor* user guide.

            You can call this operation only from the organization's management account and from the us-east-1 Region.

            If the account associated with the identity used to call `StartReportCreation` is different from the account that owns the Amazon S3 bucket, there must be a bucket policy attached to the bucket to provide access. For more information, review [Amazon S3 bucket policy for report storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tag-policies-orgs.html#bucket-policy) in the *Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor* user guide.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Removes the specified tags from the specified resources. When you specify a tag key, the action removes both that key and its associated value. The operation succeeds even if you attempt to remove tags from a resource that were already removed. Note the following:

            - To remove tags from a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for removing tags. For more information, see the documentation for the service whose resource you want to untag.
            - You can only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for the calling Amazon Web Services account.

            **Minimum permissions**

            In addition to the `tag:UntagResources` permission required by this operation, you must also have the remove tags permission defined by the service that created the resource. For example, to remove the tags from an Amazon EC2 instance using the `UntagResources` operation, you must have both of the following permissions:

            - `tag:UntagResources`
            - `ec2:DeleteTags`

            In addition, some services might have specific requirements for untagging some types of resources. For example, to untag Amazon Web Services Glue Connection, you must also have the `glue:GetConnection` permission. If the expected minimum permissions don't work, check the documentation for that service's tagging APIs for more information.

            resource-type-filters: |-
                Specifies that you want the response to include information for only resources of the specified types. The format of each resource type is `service[:resourceType]`. For example, specifying a resource type of `ec2` returns all Amazon EC2 resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of `ec2:instance` returns only EC2 instances.

                The string for each service name and resource type is the same as that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Consult the [*Amazon Web Services General Reference*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/) for the following:

                - For a list of service name strings, see [Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces).
                - For resource type strings, see [Example ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arns-syntax).
                - For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).

                For the list of services whose resources you can tag using the Resource Groups Tagging API, see [Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html). If an Amazon Web Services service isn't listed on that page, you might still be able to tag that service's resources by using that service's native tagging operations instead of using Resource Groups Tagging API operations. All tagged resources, whether the tagging used the Resource Groups Tagging API or not, are returned by the `Get*` operation.

                You can specify multiple resource types by using a comma separated array. The array can include up to 100 items. Note that the length constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter.
            starting-token: |-

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            pagination-token: Specifies a `PaginationToken` response value from a previous request to indicate that you want the next page of results. Leave this parameter empty in your initial request.
            resource-arn-list: |-
                Specifies a list of ARNs of resources for which you want to retrieve tag data.

                You can't specify both this parameter and the `ResourceTypeFilters` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an `Invalid Parameter` exception.

                You can't specify both this parameter and the `TagFilters` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an `Invalid Parameter` exception.

                You can't specify both this parameter and any of the pagination parameters (`ResourcesPerPage`, `TagsPerPage`, `PaginationToken`) in the same request. If you do, you get an `Invalid Parameter` exception.

                If a resource specified by this parameter doesn't exist, it doesn't generate an error; it simply isn't included in the response.

                An ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For more information, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
            resource-type-filters: |-
                Specifies the resource types that you want included in the response. The format of each resource type is `service[:resourceType]`. For example, specifying a service of `ec2` returns all Amazon EC2 resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of `ec2:instance` returns only EC2 instances.

                You can't specify both this parameter and the `ResourceArnList` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an `Invalid Parameter` exception.

                The string for each service name and resource type is the same as that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

                For the list of services whose resources you can tag using the Resource Groups Tagging API, see [Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html). If an Amazon Web Services service isn't listed on that page, you might still be able to tag that service's resources by using that service's native tagging operations instead of using Resource Groups Tagging API operations. All tagged resources, whether the tagging used the Resource Groups Tagging API or not, are returned by the `Get*` operation.

                You can specify multiple resource types by using an array. The array can include up to 100 items. Note that the length constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter. For example, the following string would limit the response to only Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, or any Audit Manager resource:

                `ec2:instance,s3:bucket,auditmanager`
            resources-per-page: Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned in each page. A query can return fewer than this maximum, even if there are more results still to return. You should always check the `PaginationToken` response value to see if there are more results. You can specify a minimum of 1 and a maximum value of 100.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            tag-filters: "Specifies a list of TagFilters (keys and values) to restrict the output to only those resources that have tags with the specified keys and, if included, the specified values. Each `TagFilter` must contain a key with values optional. A request can include up to 50 keys, and each key can include up to 20 values.\n\nYou can't specify both this parameter and the `ResourceArnList` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an `Invalid Parameter` exception.\n\nNote the following when deciding how to use TagFilters:\n\n- If you *don't* specify a `TagFilter`, the response includes all resources that are currently tagged or ever had a tag. Resources that were previously tagged, *but do not currently* have tags, are shown with an empty tag set, like this: `\"Tags\": []`.\n- If you specify more than one filter in a single request, the response returns only those resources that satisfy all filters.\n- If you specify a filter that contains more than one value for a key, the response returns resources that match *any* of the specified values for that key.\n- If you don't specify a value for a key, the response returns all resources that are tagged with that key, with any or no value.\n  \n  For example, for the following filters: `filter1= {key1,{value1}}`, `filter2={key2,{value2,value3,value4}}`, `filter3= {key3}`:\n  \n  - `GetResources({filter1})` returns resources tagged with `key1=value1`\n  - `GetResources({filter2})` returns resources tagged with `key2=value2` or `key2=value3` or `key2=value4`\n  - `GetResources({filter3})` returns resources tagged with any tag with the key `key3`, and with any or no value\n  - `GetResources({filter1,filter2,filter3})` returns resources tagged with `(key1=value1) and (key2=value2 or key2=value3 or key2=value4) and (key3, any or no value)`"
            tags-per-page: |-
                Amazon Web Services recommends using `ResourcesPerPage` instead of this parameter.

                A limit that restricts the number of tags (key and value pairs) returned by `GetResources` in paginated output. A resource with no tags is counted as having one tag (one key and value pair).

                `GetResources` does not split a resource and its associated tags across pages. If the specified `TagsPerPage` would cause such a break, a `PaginationToken` is returned in place of the affected resource and its tags. Use that token in another request to get the remaining data. For example, if you specify a `TagsPerPage` of `100` and the account has 22 resources with 10 tags each (meaning that each resource has 10 key and value pairs), the output will consist of three pages. The first page displays the first 10 resources, each with its 10 tags. The second page displays the next 10 resources, each with its 10 tags. The third page displays the remaining 2 resources, each with its 10 tags.

                You can set `TagsPerPage` to a minimum of 100 items up to a maximum of 500 items.

        command: |-
            Applies one or more tags to the specified resources. Note the following:

            - Not all resources can have tags. For a list of services with resources that support tagging using this operation, see [Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html). If the resource doesn't yet support this operation, the resource's service might support tagging using its own API operations. For more information, refer to the documentation for that service.
            - Each resource can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see [Tag Naming and Usage Conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html#tag-conventions) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference.*
            - You can only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for the Amazon Web Services account.
            - To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for adding tags. For more information, see the documentation for each service.
            - When you use the [Amazon Web Services Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html) to update tags for Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stack sets, Amazon Web Services calls the [Amazon Web Services CloudFormation `UpdateStack`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStack.html) operation. This operation may initiate additional resource property updates in addition to the desired tag updates. To avoid unexpected resource updates, Amazon Web Services recommends that you only apply or update tags to your CloudFormation stack sets using Amazon Web Services CloudFormation.

            Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. We use tags to provide you with billing and administration services. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.

            **Minimum permissions**

            In addition to the `tag:TagResources` permission required by this operation, you must also have the tagging permission defined by the service that created the resource. For example, to tag an Amazon EC2 instance using the `TagResources` operation, you must have both of the following permissions:

            - `tag:TagResources`
            - `ec2:CreateTags`

            In addition, some services might have specific requirements for tagging some types of resources. For example, to tag an Amazon S3 bucket, you must also have the `s3:GetBucketTagging` permission. If the expected minimum permissions don't work, check the documentation for that service's tagging APIs for more information.
