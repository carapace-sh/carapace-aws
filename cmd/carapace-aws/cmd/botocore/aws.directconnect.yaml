            Creates a BGP peer on the specified virtual interface.

            You must create a BGP peer for the corresponding address family (IPv4/IPv6) in order to access Amazon Web Services resources that also use that address family.

            If logical redundancy is not supported by the connection, interconnect, or LAG, the BGP peer cannot be in the same address family as an existing BGP peer on the virtual interface.

            When creating a IPv6 BGP peer, omit the Amazon address and customer address. IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from the Amazon pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.

            If you let Amazon Web Services auto-assign IPv4 addresses, a /30 CIDR will be allocated from 169.254.0.0/16. Amazon Web Services does not recommend this option if you intend to use the customer router peer IP address as the source and destination for traffic. Instead you should use RFC 1918 or other addressing, and specify the address yourself. For more information about RFC 1918 see [Address Allocation for Private Internets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918).

            For a public virtual interface, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) must be private or already on the allow list for the virtual interface.

        command: |-
            Creates a private virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN that transports Direct Connect traffic. A private virtual interface can be connected to either a Direct Connect gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway enables the possibility for connecting to multiple VPCs, including VPCs in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Connecting the private virtual interface to a VGW only provides access to a single VPC within the same Region.

            Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call [DescribeConnections](). To check whether your virtual interface supports jumbo frames, call [DescribeVirtualInterfaces]().

            Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical dedicated connections between the customer network and a specific Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface.

            All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth (either 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 100Gbps, or 400Gbps) and must terminate at the same Direct Connect endpoint.

            You can have up to 10 dedicated connections per location. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created..

            You can specify an existing physical dedicated connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical dedicated connection, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same Direct Connect endpoint to which the dedicated connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the dedicated connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change.

            If the Amazon Web Services account used to create a LAG is a registered Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.

You can re-associate a connection that's currently associated with a different LAG; however, if removing the connection would cause the original LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails.

            Creates an interconnect between an Direct Connect Partner's network and a specific Direct Connect location.

            An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting other connections. The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an Direct Connect router.

            You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created.

            For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling [AllocateHostedConnection](). The end customer can then connect to Amazon Web Services resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned to them by the Direct Connect Partner.

            Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only.

            Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the [DeleteConnection]() request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A disassociated connection owned by an Direct Connect Partner is automatically converted to an interconnect.

            If disassociating the connection would cause the LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails, except when it's the last member of the LAG. If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no physical connections.

            Creates a transit virtual interface. A transit virtual interface should be used to access one or more transit gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways. A transit virtual interface enables the connection of multiple VPCs attached to a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway.

            If you associate your transit gateway with one or more Direct Connect gateways, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) used by the transit gateway and the Direct Connect gateway must be different. For example, if you use the default ASN 64512 for both your the transit gateway and Direct Connect gateway, the association request fails.

            A jumbo MTU value must be either 1500 or 8500. No other values will be accepted. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds.
