                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            image-id: |-
                The identifier for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that's used to create the EC2 instance. To choose an AMI for the instance, you must specify a valid AMI alias or a valid Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM) path.

                We recommend using Amazon Linux 2023 as the AMI to create your environment as it is fully supported.

                From December 16, 2024, Ubuntu 18.04 will be removed from the list of available `imageIds` for Cloud9. This change is necessary as Ubuntu 18.04 has ended standard support on May 31, 2023. This change will only affect direct API consumers, and not Cloud9 console users.

                Since Ubuntu 18.04 has ended standard support as of May 31, 2023, we recommend you choose Ubuntu 22.04.

                **AMI aliases**

                - Amazon Linux 2: `amazonlinux-2-x86_64`
                - Amazon Linux 2023 (recommended): `amazonlinux-2023-x86_64`
