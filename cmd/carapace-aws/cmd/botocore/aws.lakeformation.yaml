Lake Formation defines privileges to grant and revoke access to metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3. Lake Formation requires that each principal be authorized to perform a specific task on Lake Formation resources.
            permissions-with-grant-option: Indicates a list of the granted permissions that the principal may pass to other users. These permissions may only be a subset of the permissions granted in the `Privileges`.
            principal: |-
                The principal to be granted the permissions on the resource. Supported principals are IAM users or IAM roles, and they are defined by their principal type and their ARN.

                Note that if you define a resource with a particular ARN, then later delete, and recreate a resource with that same ARN, the resource maintains the permissions already granted.
            resource: The resource to which permissions are to be granted. Resources in Lake Formation are the Data Catalog, databases, and tables.

            Returns a list of the principal permissions on the resource, filtered by the permissions of the caller. For example, if you are granted an ALTER permission, you are able to see only the principal permissions for ALTER.

            This operation returns only those permissions that have been explicitly granted. If both `Principal` and `Resource` parameters are provided, the response returns effective permissions rather than the explicitly granted permissions.

            Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog.

            To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen data location. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.

            The following request registers a new location and gives Lake Formation permission to use the service-linked role to access that location.

            `ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/ UseServiceLinkedRole = true`

            If `UseServiceLinkedRole` is not set to true, you must provide or set the `RoleArn`:

            Allows a caller to assume an IAM role decorated as the SAML user specified in the SAML assertion included in the request. This decoration allows Lake Formation to enforce access policies against the SAML users and groups. This API operation requires SAML federation setup in the caller’s account as it can only be called with valid SAML assertions. Lake Formation does not scope down the permission of the assumed role. All permissions attached to the role via the SAML federation setup will be included in the role session.

            This decorated role is expected to access data in Amazon S3 by getting temporary access from Lake Formation which is authorized via the virtual API `GetDataAccess`. Therefore, all SAML roles that can be assumed via `AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML` must at a minimum include `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` in their role policies. A typical IAM policy attached to such a role would include the following actions:

            - glue:\*Database*
            - glue:\*Table*
            - glue:\*Partition*
