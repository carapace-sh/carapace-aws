            Creates an Amazon Kinesis Video Stream pool for use with media stream pipelines.

            If a meeting uses an opt-in Region as its [MediaRegion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_CreateMeeting.html#chimesdk-meeting-chime_CreateMeeting-request-MediaRegion), the KVS stream must be in that same Region. For example, if a meeting uses the `af-south-1` Region, the KVS stream must also be in `af-south-1`. However, if the meeting uses a Region that AWS turns on by default, the KVS stream can be in any available Region, including an opt-in Region. For example, if the meeting uses `ca-central-1`, the KVS stream can be in `eu-west-2`, `us-east-1`, `af-south-1`, or any other Region that the Amazon Chime SDK supports.

            To learn which AWS Region a meeting uses, call the [GetMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_GetMeeting.html) API and use the [MediaRegion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_CreateMeeting.html#chimesdk-meeting-chime_CreateMeeting-request-MediaRegion) parameter from the response.

            For more information about opt-in Regions, refer to [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/sdk-available-regions.html) in the *Amazon Chime SDK Developer Guide*, and [Specify which AWS Regions your account can use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html#rande-manage-enable.html), in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*.
