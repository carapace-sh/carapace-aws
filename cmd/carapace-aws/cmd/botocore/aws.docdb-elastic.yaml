                The Amazon Web Services KMS key ID for an encrypted elastic cluster snapshot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier, or the Amazon Web Services KMS key alias for the Amazon Web Services KMS encryption key.

                If you copy an encrypted elastic cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services account, you can specify a value for `KmsKeyId` to encrypt the copy with a new Amazon Web ServicesS KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for `KmsKeyId`, then the copy of the elastic cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same `AWS` KMS key as the source elastic cluster snapshot.

                To copy an encrypted elastic cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services region, set `KmsKeyId` to the Amazon Web Services KMS key ID that you want to use to encrypt the copy of the elastic cluster snapshot in the destination region. Amazon Web Services KMS encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services region that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon Web Services region in another Amazon Web Services region.

                If you copy an unencrypted elastic cluster snapshot and specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, an error is returned.
            snapshot-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifier of the elastic cluster snapshot.

                The identifier of the new elastic cluster snapshot to create from the source cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

                The type of cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

                - `automated` - Return all cluster snapshots that Amazon DocumentDB has automatically created for your Amazon Web Services account.
                - `manual` - Return all cluster snapshots that you have manually created for your Amazon Web Services account.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `maxResults` value, a pagination token (marker) is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.
            next-token: An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by `maxResults`.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
