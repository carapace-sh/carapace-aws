            You can't use this operation if the service and service network are already associated or if there is a disassociation or deletion in progress. If the association fails, you can retry the operation by deleting the association and recreating it.

            As a result of this operation, the association is created in the service network account and the association owner account.

For more information, see [Listeners](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/listeners.html) in the *Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide*.

            If you add a security group to the service network and VPC association, the association must continue to always have at least one security group. You can add or edit security groups at any time. However, to remove all security groups, you must first delete the association and recreate it without security groups.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
