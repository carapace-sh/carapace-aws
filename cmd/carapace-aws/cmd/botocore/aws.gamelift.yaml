            Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions.

            This action can be used in the following ways:

            - To retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID only.
            - To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide the game session ID only.
            - To retrieve all player sessions for a specific player, provide a player ID only.

            To request player sessions, specify either a player session ID, game session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session status. If you provide a specific `PlayerSessionId` or `PlayerId`, Amazon GameLift Servers ignores the filter criteria. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

            If successful, a `PlayerSession` object is returned for each session that matches the request.

            Updates Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ-specific properties for a game server group. Many Auto Scaling group properties are updated on the Auto Scaling group directly, including the launch template, Auto Scaling policies, and maximum/minimum/desired instance counts.

            To update the game server group, specify the game server group ID and provide the updated values. Before applying the updates, the new values are validated to ensure that Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ can continue to perform instance balancing activity. If successful, a `GameServerGroup` object is returned.

                Indicates how Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

                - `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
                - `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
                - `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.

            Retrieves the resource capacity settings for one or more fleets. For a container fleet, this operation also returns counts for game server container groups.

            With multi-location fleets, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. To retrieve capacity for remote locations, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API\_DescribeFleetLocationCapacity.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetLocationCapacity.html).

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To get capacity data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.
            - To get capacity data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

            When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

            If successful, a `FleetCapacity` object is returned for each requested fleet ID. Each `FleetCapacity` object includes a `Location` property, which is set to the fleet's home Region. Capacity values are returned only for fleets that currently exist.

            Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs that are allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

            Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.

            When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift Servers managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a `GameSessions` ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the `GameSession` resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.

            When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.

            To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the `GameSession` ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

            Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

            Updates capacity settings for a managed EC2 fleet or managed container fleet. For these fleets, you adjust capacity by changing the number of instances in the fleet. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that the fleet can host based on its configuration. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually.

            Use this operation to set these fleet capacity properties:

            - Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on the number of Amazon EC2 instances allowed. If Amazon GameLift Servers receives a request--either through manual update or automatic scaling--it won't change the capacity to a value outside of this range.
            - Desired capacity: As an alternative to automatic scaling, manually set the number of Amazon EC2 instances to be maintained. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, check the maximum capacity of the fleet's Amazon EC2 instance type by calling [DescribeEC2InstanceLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeEC2InstanceLimits.html).

            To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the `Location` parameter. The fleet must be in `ACTIVE` status.

            To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, set the `Location` parameter to the location to update. The location must be in `ACTIVE` status.

            If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers updates the capacity settings and returns the identifiers for the updated fleet and/or location. If a requested change to desired capacity exceeds the instance type's limit, the `LimitExceeded` exception occurs.

            Updates often prompt an immediate change in fleet capacity, such as when current capacity is different than the new desired capacity or outside the new limits. In this scenario, Amazon GameLift Servers automatically initiates steps to add or remove instances in the fleet location. You can track a fleet's current capacity by calling [DescribeFleetCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetCapacity.html) or [DescribeFleetLocationCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetLocationCapacity.html).

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

            Updates the runtime configuration for the specified fleet. The runtime configuration tells Amazon GameLift Servers how to launch server processes on computes in managed EC2 and Anywhere fleets. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in `ACTIVE` status.

            To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a `RuntimeConfiguration` with an updated set of server process configurations.

            If successful, the fleet's runtime configuration settings are updated. Fleet computes that run game server processes regularly check for and receive updated runtime configurations. The computes immediately take action to comply with the new configuration by launching new server processes or by not replacing existing processes when they shut down. Updating a fleet's runtime configuration never affects existing server processes.

            Retrieves information on a fleet's remote locations, including life-cycle status and any suspended fleet activity.

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and a list of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is requested.
            - To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Location data is returned in no particular order.

            When requesting attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

            If successful, a `LocationAttributes` object is returned for each requested location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no information is returned. This operation does not return the home Region. To get information on a fleet's home Region, call `DescribeFleetAttributes`.

            To update fleet attributes, specify the fleet ID and the property values that you want to change. If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers returns the identifiers for the updated fleet.

            A managed fleet's runtime environment, which depends on the fleet's Amazon Machine Image {AMI} version, can't be updated. You must create a new fleet. As a best practice, we recommend replacing your managed fleets every 30 days to maintain a secure and up-to-date runtime environment for your hosted game servers.

            Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift Servers hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also using Amazon GameLift Servers hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with that configuration.

            To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without Amazon GameLift Servers hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift Servers hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a game session for the match.

            In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service topic to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration.

            acceptance-timeout-seconds: The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required.
            additional-player-count: The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used if `FlexMatchMode` is set to `STANDALONE`.

            game-properties: 'A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: `{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}`. This information is added to the new `GameSession` object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if `FlexMatchMode` is set to `STANDALONE`.'
            game-session-data: A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see [Start a game session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession). This information is added to the new `GameSession` object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if `FlexMatchMode` is set to `STANDALONE`.
            game-session-queue-arns: The Amazon Resource Name ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html)) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is `arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`. Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new Amazon GameLift Servers-hosted game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. If `FlexMatchMode` is set to `STANDALONE`, do not set this parameter.

            request-timeout-seconds: The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.
            rule-set-name: A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.
            tags: A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation.

            Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in `ACTIVE` status and has a player creation policy of `ACCEPT_ALL`. To add a single player to a game session, use [CreatePlayerSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSession.html)

            To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs. Optionally, provide a set of player data for each player ID.

            If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player, and new `PlayerSession` objects are returned with player session IDs. Each player references their player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the Amazon GameLift Servers service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

            The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable.

            Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. Utilization data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are currently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See [DescribeFleetLocationUtilization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetLocationUtilization.html) to get utilization statistics for a fleet's remote locations.

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To get utilization data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.
            - To get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

            When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

            If successful, a [FleetUtilization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_FleetUtilization.html) object is returned for each requested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each fleet utilization object includes a `Location` property, which is set to the fleet's home Region.

            Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

            Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an Amazon Web Services account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. You can peer with VPCs in any Amazon Web Services account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift Servers fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For more information, see [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Servers Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html).

            Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to use [CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html) and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc.

            To establish the connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift Servers fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a connection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using [DescribeVpcPeeringConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeVpcPeeringConnections.html) , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using [DescribeFleetEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetEvents.html) .

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift Servers to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.

            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.

            Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in [Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html).

            **Target-based policy**

            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift Servers to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.

            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift Servers to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift Servers will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.

            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a `TargetConfiguration` object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

            **Rule-based policy**

            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.

            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."

            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:

            If `[MetricName]` is `[ComparisonOperator]` `[Threshold]` for `[EvaluationPeriods]` minutes, then `[ScalingAdjustmentType]` to/by `[ScalingAdjustment]`.

            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:

            If `[PercentIdleInstances]` is `[GreaterThanThreshold]` `[20]` for `[15]` minutes, then `[PercentChangeInCapacity]` to/by `[10]`.

            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

            Requests an authentication token from Amazon GameLift Servers for a compute resource in an Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. Game servers that are running on the compute use this token to communicate with the Amazon GameLift Servers service, such as when calling the Amazon GameLift Servers server SDK action `InitSDK()`. Authentication tokens are valid for a limited time span, so you need to request a fresh token before the current token expires.

            **Request options**

            - For managed EC2 fleets (compute type `EC2`), auth token retrieval and refresh is handled automatically. All game servers that are running on all fleet instances have access to a valid auth token.
            - For Anywhere fleets (compute type `ANYWHERE`), if you're using the Amazon GameLift Servers Agent, auth token retrieval and refresh is handled automatically for any compute where the Agent is running. If you're not using the Agent, create a mechanism to retrieve and refresh auth tokens for computes that are running game server processes.

        command: "**This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container\n\nRetrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them into a specified order.\n\nThis operation is not designed to continually track game session status because that practice can cause you to exceed your API limit and generate errors. Instead, configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications from a matchmaker or a game session placement queue.\n\nWhen searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations.\n\nThis operation can be used in the following ways:\n\n- To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.\n- To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location.\n\nUse the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.\n\nIf successful, a `GameSession` object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in `ACTIVE` status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use [DescribeGameSessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessions.html).\n\nTo set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes. For game session search examples, see the Examples section of this topic.\n\n- **gameSessionId** -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a `GameSessionId` or `GameSessionArn` value.\n- **gameSessionName** -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.\n- **gameSessionProperties** -- A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: `{\"Key\": \"difficulty\", \"Value\": \"novice\"}`. The filter expression must specify the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API\\_GameProperty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameProperty) -- a `Key` and a string `Value` to search for the game sessions.\n  \n  For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the following search filter: `gameSessionProperties.difficulty = \"novice\"`. All game property values are searched as strings.\n  \n  For examples of searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see [Search game sessions by game property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties-search).\n- **maximumSessions** -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.\n- **creationTimeMillis** -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.\n- **playerSessionCount** -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.\n- **hasAvailablePlayerSessions** -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.\n\nReturned values for `playerSessionCount` and `hasAvailablePlayerSessions` change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.\n\n[All APIs by task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets)"

                String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in `ACTIVE` status.

                A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:

                - **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`, `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`, `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
                - **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
                - **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators `=` and `<>`. For example, the following filter expression searches on `gameSessionName`: "`FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'"`.

                To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` and parentheses as needed. For example: `x AND y AND NOT z`, `NOT (x OR y)`.

                Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:

                1. `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
                2. Parentheses
                3. NOT
                4. AND
                5. OR

                For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: `"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`.
            fleet-id: A unique identifier for the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            limit: The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum number of results returned is 20, even if this value is not set or is set higher than 20.
            location: A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Services Region code format, such as `us-west-2`.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            next-token: A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-expression: |-
                Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:

                - **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`, `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`, `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
                - **Order** -- Valid sort orders are `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC` (descending).

                For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: `"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`. Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional status filter. This approach returns details from the fleet's home Region and all remote locations.
            - To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, with optional status filter. The location can be the fleet's home Region or any remote location.

            This operation is not designed to be continually called to track game session status. This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, you must configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications from FlexMatch or queues. Continuously polling with `DescribeGameSessions` should only be used for games in development with low game session usage.

The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift Servers uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the `ObjectVersion` parameter to specify an earlier version.

                A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.

                When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: `--zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip`.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere

            Creates a new Amazon GameLift Servers build resource for your game server binary files. Combine game server binaries into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift Servers.

            When setting up a new game build for Amazon GameLift Servers, we recommend using the CLI command [**upload-build**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html) . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to an Amazon GameLift Servers Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource.

            You can use the `CreateBuild` operation in the following scenarios:

            - Create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an Amazon Web Services account that you control. To use this option, you give Amazon GameLift Servers access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build.
            - Upload your build files to a Amazon GameLift Servers Amazon S3 location. To use this option, specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see [Uploading Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html) in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*. After you upload build files to the Amazon GameLift Servers Amazon S3 location, you can't update them.

            If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in `INITIALIZED` status. A build must be in `READY` status before you can create fleets with it.

You can't change a build's operating system later.

                Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2025. See more details in the [Amazon Linux 2 FAQs](http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/faqs/). For game servers that are hosted on AL2 and use server SDK version 4.x for Amazon GameLift Servers, first update the game server build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See [Migrate to server SDK version 5.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-serversdk5-migration.html)
            server-sdk-version: A server SDK version you used when integrating your game server build with Amazon GameLift Servers.

The storage location must specify an Amazon S3 bucket name and key. The location must also specify a role ARN that you set up to allow Amazon GameLift Servers to access your Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 bucket and your new build must be in the same Region.

                If a `StorageLocation` is specified, the size of your file can be found in your Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon GameLift Servers will report a `SizeOnDisk` of 0.

            Adds remote locations to an EC2 and begins populating the new locations with instances. The new instances conform to the fleet's instance type, auto-scaling, and other configuration settings.

            You can't add remote locations to a fleet that resides in an Amazon Web Services Region that doesn't support multiple locations. Fleets created prior to March 2021 can't support multiple locations.

            To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or more locations.

            If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status set to `NEW`. Amazon GameLift Servers initiates the process of starting an instance in each added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location creation events using [DescribeFleetEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetEvents.html).

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

            Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location. This operation prompts an available server process to start a game session and retrieves connection information for the new game session. As an alternative, consider using the Amazon GameLift Servers game session placement feature with [StartGameSessionPlacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartGameSessionPlacement.html), which uses the FleetIQ algorithm and queues to optimize the placement process.

            When creating a game session, you specify exactly where you want to place it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The target fleet must be in `ACTIVE` status.

            You can use this operation in the following ways:

            - To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's home Region, provide a fleet or alias ID along with your game session configuration.
            - To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's remote location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game session configuration.
            - To create a game session on an instance in an Anywhere fleet, specify the fleet's custom location.

            If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers initiates a workflow to start a new game session and returns a `GameSession` object containing the game session configuration and status. When the game session status is `ACTIVE`, it is updated with connection information and you can create player sessions for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using [UpdateGameSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateGameSession.html) to change the game session's player session creation policy.

            Amazon GameLift Servers retains logs for active for 14 days. To access the logs, call [GetGameSessionLogUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetGameSessionLogUrl.html) to download the log files.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

            Retrieves the instance limits and current utilization for an Amazon Web Services Region or location. Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location, that your Amazon Web Services account can use. Learn more at [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your Amazon GameLift Servers fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account by using the **Service limits** page in the Amazon GameLift Servers console.

            Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an Amazon Web Services Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results:

            - Request specifies the Region `ap-northeast-1` with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in `us-east-2`, by all of the fleets that reside in `ap-northeast-1`.
            - Request specifies the Region `us-east-1` with location `ca-central-1`. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in `ca-central-1`, by all of the fleets that reside in `us-east-2`. These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to `ca-central-1`.
            - Request specifies the Region `eu-west-1` with location `ca-central-1`. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in `ca-central-1`, by all of the fleets that reside in `eu-west-1`.

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an Amazon Web Services Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.
            - To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed to a remote location by fleets that reside in different Amazon Web Services Region: Provide both the Amazon Web Services Region and the remote location. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.

            If successful, an `EC2InstanceLimits` object is returned with limits and usage data for each requested instance type.

            Creates a new script record for your Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime script. Realtime scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create a Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session.

            To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these locations:

            - A locally available directory. Use the *ZipFile* parameter for this option.
            - An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your Amazon Web Services account. Use the *StorageLocation* parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift Servers service to access your S3 bucket.

            If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift Servers-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift Servers accesses the file at this storage location as needed for deployment.

            Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your Amazon Web Services account. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. After you've received authorization, use [CreateVpcPeeringConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringConnection.html) to establish the peering connection. For more information, see [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Servers Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html).

            You can peer with VPCs that are owned by any Amazon Web Services account you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift Servers fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions.

            To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. For example, to enable your game servers to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift Servers. If successful, VPC peering is authorized for the specified VPC.

            To request authorization to delete a connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that is peered with your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID that you want to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift Servers.

            The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled. You must create or delete the peering connection while the authorization is valid.

            Deletes all resources and information related to a fleet and shuts down any currently running fleet instances, including those in remote locations.

            If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling [CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html). You don't need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection.

            To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process, the fleet status is changed to `DELETING`. When completed, the status switches to `TERMINATED` and the fleet event `FLEET_DELETED` is emitted.

For a managed container fleet, this operation also returns counts for game server container groups.

            Use this operation to retrieve capacity information for a fleet's remote location or home Region (you can also retrieve home Region capacity by calling `DescribeFleetCapacity`).

            To retrieve capacity data, identify a fleet and location.

            If successful, a `FleetCapacity` object is returned for the requested fleet location.

            Retrieves a fleet's runtime configuration settings. The runtime configuration determines which server processes run, and how, on computes in the fleet. For managed EC2 fleets, the runtime configuration describes server processes that run on each fleet instance. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time using [UpdateRuntimeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateRuntimeConfiguration.html).

            To get the current runtime configuration for a fleet, provide the fleet ID.

            If successful, a `RuntimeConfiguration` object is returned for the requested fleet. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the result set is empty.

            Requests authorization to remotely connect to an instance in an Amazon GameLift Servers managed fleet. Use this operation to connect to instances with game servers that use Amazon GameLift Servers server SDK 4.x or earlier. To connect to instances with game servers that use server SDK 5.x or later, call [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API\_GetComputeAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetComputeAccess).

            To request access to an instance, specify IDs for the instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve instance IDs for a fleet by calling [DescribeInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeInstances.html) with the fleet ID.

            If successful, this operation returns an IP address and credentials. The returned credentials match the operating system of the instance, as follows:

            - For a Windows instance: returns a user name and secret (password) for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client.
            - For a Linux instance: returns a user name and secret (RSA private key) for use with an SSH client. You must save the secret to a `.pem` file. If you're using the CLI, see the example [Get credentials for a Linux instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetInstanceAccess.html#API_GetInstanceAccess_Examples) for tips on automatically saving the secret to a `.pem` file.

            Retrieves a collection of fleet resources in an Amazon Web Services Region. You can filter the result set to find only those fleets that are deployed with a specific build or script. For fleets that have multiple locations, this operation retrieves fleets based on their home Region only.

            You can use operation in the following ways:

            - To get a list of all fleets in a Region, don't provide a build or script identifier.
            - To get a list of all fleets where a specific game build is deployed, provide the build ID.
            - To get a list of all Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime fleets with a specific configuration script, provide the script ID.

            Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use Amazon GameLift Servers managed hosting, this operation also triggers Amazon GameLift Servers to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.

            To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to `QUEUED`.

            Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service, which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.

            Creates a new game server resource and notifies Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. Registering game servers enables Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ to track available game servers and enables game clients and services to claim a game server for a new game session.

            To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for the game server. You can also include connection and game server data.

            Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status `AVAILABLE`. A request to register a game server may fail if the instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance balancing or scale-down activity.

            This call is also used to turn off automatic backfill for an individual game session. This is for game sessions that are created with a matchmaking configuration that has automatic backfill enabled. The ticket ID is included in the `MatchmakerData` of an updated game session object, which is provided to the game server.

            Requests authorization to remotely connect to a hosting resource in a Amazon GameLift Servers managed fleet. This operation is not used with Amazon GameLift Servers Anywhere fleets.

            **Request options**

            Provide the fleet ID and compute name. The compute name varies depending on the type of fleet.

            - For a compute in a managed EC2 fleet, provide an instance ID. Each instance in the fleet is a compute.
            - For a compute in a managed container fleet, provide a compute name. In a container fleet, each game server container group on a fleet instance is assigned a compute name.

            **Results**

            If successful, this operation returns a set of temporary Amazon Web Services credentials, including a two-part access key and a session token.

            - With a managed EC2 fleet (where compute type is `EC2`), use these credentials with Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM) to start a session with the compute. For more details, see [Starting a session (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html#sessions-start-cli) in the *Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide*.

            Registers a compute resource in an Amazon GameLift Servers Anywhere fleet.

            For an Anywhere fleet that's running the Amazon GameLift Servers Agent, the Agent handles all compute registry tasks for you. For an Anywhere fleet that doesn't use the Agent, call this operation to register fleet computes.

            To register a compute, give the compute a name (must be unique within the fleet) and specify the compute resource's DNS name or IP address. Provide a fleet ID and a fleet location to associate with the compute being registered. You can optionally include the path to a TLS certificate on the compute resource.

            If successful, this operation returns compute details, including an Amazon GameLift Servers SDK endpoint or Agent endpoint. Game server processes running on the compute can use this endpoint to communicate with the Amazon GameLift Servers service. Each server process includes the SDK endpoint in its call to the Amazon GameLift Servers server SDK action `InitSDK()`.

            To view compute details, call [DescribeCompute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeCompute.html) with the compute name.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

            Retrieves a fleet's inbound connection permissions. Connection permissions specify IP addresses and port settings that incoming traffic can use to access server processes in the fleet. Game server processes that are running in the fleet must use a port that falls within this range.

            Use this operation in the following ways:

            - To retrieve the port settings for a fleet, identify the fleet's unique identifier.
            - To check the status of recent updates to a fleet remote location, specify the fleet ID and a location. Port setting updates can take time to propagate across all locations.

            If successful, a set of `IpPermission` objects is returned for the requested fleet ID. When specifying a location, this operation returns a pending status. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the result set is empty.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2 (FleetIQ)

            Creates a Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your Amazon Web Services account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the Amazon GameLift Servers console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

            Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:

            - An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances with your game server build. For more information, see [Launching an Instance from a Launch Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
            - An IAM role that extends limited access to your Amazon Web Services account to allow Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see [Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html) in the *Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

            To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ metric.

            Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

                - `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
                - `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
                - `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.

            game-server-protection-policy: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status. This property is set to `NO_PROTECTION` by default.

For more information on instance types, see [EC2 Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see [Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

For help with creating a launch template, see [Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide*. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.

                If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property `AssociatePublicIpAddress` to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
            max-size: The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
            min-size: The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
            role-arn: The Amazon Resource Name ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html)) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift Servers to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
            tags: A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources is useful for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
            vpc-subnets: A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in the game server group. By default, all Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

            Creates a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes the type of match to create, such as the number and size of teams. It also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type.

            To create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and the rule set body in JSON format. Rule sets must be defined in the same Region as the matchmaking configuration they are used with.

            Since matchmaking rule sets cannot be edited, it is a good idea to check the rule set syntax using [ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet.html) before creating a new rule set.

An Amazon GameLift Servers container group is similar to a container task or pod. Use container group definitions when you create a container fleet with [CreateContainerFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerFleet.html).\n\nA container group definition determines how Amazon GameLift Servers deploys your containers to each instance in a container fleet. You can maintain multiple versions of a container group definition.\n\nThere are two types of container groups:\n\n- A **game server container group** has the containers that run your game server application and supporting software. A game server container group can have these container types:\n  \n  - Game server container. This container runs your game server. You can define one game server container in a game server container group.\n  - Support container. This container runs software in parallel with your game server. You can define up to 8 support containers in a game server group.\n  \n  When building a game server container group definition, you can choose to bundle your game server executable and all dependent software into a single game server container. Alternatively, you can separate the software into one game server container and one or more support containers.\n  \n  On a container fleet instance, a game server container group can be deployed multiple times (depending on the compute resources of the instance). This means that all containers in the container group are replicated together.\n- A **per-instance container group** has containers for processes that aren't replicated on a container fleet instance. This might include background services, logging, test processes, or processes that need to persist independently of the game server container group. When building a per-instance container group, you can define up to 10 support containers.\n\nThis operation requires Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to access container images in Amazon ECR repositories. See [IAM permissions for Amazon GameLift Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-iam-policy-examples.html) for help setting the appropriate permissions.\n\n**Request options**\n\nUse this operation to make the following types of requests. You can specify values for the minimum required parameters and customize optional values later.\n\n- Create a game server container group definition. Provide the following required parameter values:\n  \n  - `Name`\n  - `ContainerGroupType` (`GAME_SERVER`)\n  - `OperatingSystem` (omit to use default value)\n  - `TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes` (omit to use default value)\n  - `TotalVcpuLimit`(omit to use default value)\n  - At least one `GameServerContainerDefinition`\n    \n    - `ContainerName`\n    - `ImageUrl`\n    - `PortConfiguration`\n    - `ServerSdkVersion` (omit to use default value)\n- Create a per-instance container group definition. Provide the following required parameter values:\n  \n  - `Name`\n  - `ContainerGroupType` (`PER_INSTANCE`)\n  - `OperatingSystem` (omit to use default value)\n  - `TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes` (omit to use default value)\n  - `TotalVcpuLimit`(omit to use default value)\n  - At least one `SupportContainerDefinition`\n    \n    - `ContainerName`\n    - `ImageUrl`\n\n**Results**\n\nIf successful, this request creates a `ContainerGroupDefinition` resource and assigns a unique ARN value. You can update most properties of a container group definition by calling [UpdateContainerGroupDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateContainerGroupDefinition.html), and optionally save the update as a new version."

            **Request options**

            Provide the fleet ID and compute name. The compute name varies depending on the type of fleet.

            - For a compute in a managed EC2 fleet, provide an instance ID. Each instance in the fleet is a compute.
            - For a compute in a managed container fleet, provide a compute name. In a container fleet, each game server container group on a fleet instance is assigned a compute name.
            - For a compute in an Anywhere fleet, provide a registered compute name. Anywhere fleet computes are created when you register a hosting resource with the fleet.

            **Results**

            If successful, this operation returns details for the requested compute resource. Depending on the fleet's compute type, the result includes the following information:

            - For a managed EC2 fleet, this operation returns information about the EC2 instance.

            Retrieves status information about the Amazon EC2 instances associated with a Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ game server group. Use this operation to detect when instances are active or not available to host new game servers.

            To request status for all instances in the game server group, provide a game server group ID only. To request status for specific instances, provide the game server group ID and one or more instance IDs. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in sequential segments. If successful, a collection of `GameServerInstance` objects is returned.

            This operation is not designed to be called with every game server claim request; this practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, cache the results and refresh your cache no more than once every 10 seconds.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

            Ends a game session that's currently in progress. Use this action to terminate any game session that isn't in `ERROR` status. Terminating a game session is the most efficient way to free up a server process when it's hosting a game session that's in a bad state or not ending properly. You can use this action to terminate a game session that's being hosted on any type of Amazon GameLift Servers fleet compute, including computes for managed EC2, managed container, and Anywhere fleets. The game server must be integrated with Amazon GameLift Servers server SDK 5.x or greater.

            **Request options**

            Request termination for a single game session. Provide the game session ID and the termination mode. There are two potential methods for terminating a game session:

            - Initiate a graceful termination using the normal game session shutdown sequence. With this mode, the Amazon GameLift Servers service prompts the server process that's hosting the game session by calling the server SDK callback method `OnProcessTerminate()`. The callback implementation is part of the custom game server code. It might involve a variety of actions to gracefully end a game session, such as notifying players, before stopping the server process.
            - Force an immediate game session termination. With this mode, the Amazon GameLift Servers service takes action to stop the server process, which ends the game session without the normal game session shutdown sequence.

            **Results**

            If successful, game session termination is initiated. During this activity, the game session status is changed to `TERMINATING`. When completed, the server process that was hosting the game session has been stopped and replaced with a new server process that's ready to host a new game session. The old game session's status is changed to `TERMINATED` with a status reason that indicates the termination method used.

            Updates the properties of a managed container fleet. Depending on the properties being updated, this operation might initiate a fleet deployment. You can track deployments for a fleet using [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API\_DescribeFleetDeployment.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetDeployment.html).

            A managed fleet's runtime environment, which depends on the fleet's Amazon Machine Image {AMI} version, can't be updated. You must create a new fleet. As a best practice, we recommend replacing your managed fleets every 30 days to maintain a secure and up-to-date runtime environment for your hosted game servers. For guidance, see [Security best practices for Amazon GameLift Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftservers/latest/developerguide/security-best-practices.html).

            **Request options**

            As with CreateContainerFleet, many fleet properties use common defaults or are calculated based on the fleet's container group definitions.

            - Update fleet properties that result in a fleet deployment. Include only those properties that you want to change. Specify deployment configuration settings.
            - Update fleet properties that don't result in a fleet deployment. Include only those properties that you want to change.

            Changes to the following properties initiate a fleet deployment:

            - `GameServerContainerGroupDefinition`
            - `PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinition`
            - `GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance`

            If successful, this operation updates the container fleet resource, and might initiate a new deployment of fleet resources using the deployment configuration provided. A deployment replaces existing fleet instances with new instances that are deployed with the updated fleet properties. The fleet is placed in `UPDATING` status until the deployment is complete, then return to `ACTIVE`.

            You can have only one update deployment active at a time for a fleet. If a second update request initiates a deployment while another deployment is in progress, the first deployment is cancelled.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.

            Amazon GameLift Servers supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.

            To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling `UpdateAlias`.

            Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this operation is used to stop auto-scaling activity. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.

            Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.
            - To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend.

            If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual changes using [UpdateFleetCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateFleetCapacity.html). To restart fleet actions again, call [StartFleetActions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartFleetActions.html).

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

            Creates a fleet of compute resources to host your game servers. Use this operation to set up a fleet for the following compute types:

            **Managed EC2 fleet**

            An EC2 fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Your game server build is deployed to each fleet instance. Amazon GameLift Servers manages the fleet's instances and controls the lifecycle of game server processes, which host game sessions for players. EC2 fleets can have instances in multiple locations. Each instance in the fleet is designated a `Compute`.

            To create an EC2 fleet, provide these required parameters:

            - Either `BuildId` or `ScriptId`
            - `ComputeType` set to `EC2` (the default value)
            - `EC2InboundPermissions`
            - `EC2InstanceType`
            - `FleetType`
            - `Name`
            - `RuntimeConfiguration` with at least one `ServerProcesses` configuration

            If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in `NEW` status while Amazon GameLift Servers initiates the [fleet creation workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-all.html#fleets-creation-workflow). To debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or other actions on the fleet, create a development fleet with port 22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.

            When the fleet status is ACTIVE, you can adjust capacity settings and turn autoscaling on/off for each location.

            A managed fleet's runtime environment depends on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) version it uses. When a new fleet is created, Amazon GameLift Servers assigns the latest available AMI version to the fleet, and all compute instances in that fleet are deployed with that version. To update the AMI version, you must create a new fleet. As a best practice, we recommend replacing your managed fleets every 30 days to maintain a secure and up-to-date runtime environment for your hosted game servers. For guidance, see [Security best practices for Amazon GameLift Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftservers/latest/developerguide/security-best-practices.html).

            **Anywhere fleet**

            An Anywhere fleet represents compute resources that are not owned or managed by Amazon GameLift Servers. You might create an Anywhere fleet with your local machine for testing, or use one to host game servers with on-premises hardware or other game hosting solutions.

            To create an Anywhere fleet, provide these required parameters:

            - `ComputeType` set to `ANYWHERE`
            - `Locations` specifying a custom location
            - `Name`

            If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in `ACTIVE` status. You can register computes with a fleet in `ACTIVE` status.

            build-id: The unique identifier for a custom game server build to be deployed to a fleet with compute type `EC2`. You can use either the build ID or ARN. The build must be uploaded to Amazon GameLift Servers and in `READY` status. This fleet property can't be changed after the fleet is created.
            certificate-configuration: |-
                Prompts Amazon GameLift Servers to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. Amazon GameLift Servers uses the certificates to encrypt traffic between game clients and the game servers running on Amazon GameLift Servers. By default, the `CertificateConfiguration` is `DISABLED`. You can't change this property after you create the fleet.

                Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition.

                ACM isn't available in all Amazon Web Services regions. A fleet creation request with certificate generation enabled in an unsupported Region, fails with a 4xx error. For more information about the supported Regions, see [Supported Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html) in the *Certificate Manager User Guide*.

                - `ANYWHERE` – Game servers and supporting software are deployed to compute resources that you provide and manage. With this compute type, you can also set the `AnywhereConfiguration` parameter.
            description: A description for the fleet.
            ec2-inbound-permissions: The IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game server processes and other processes on this fleet. Set this parameter for managed EC2 fleets. You can leave this parameter empty when creating the fleet, but you must call [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API\_UpdateFleetPortSettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateFleetPortSettings) to set it before players can connect to game sessions. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished. For Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime fleets, Amazon GameLift Servers automatically sets TCP and UDP ranges.
            ec2-instance-type: The Amazon GameLift Servers-supported Amazon EC2 instance type to use with managed EC2 fleets. Instance type determines the computing resources that will be used to host your game servers, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. See [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for detailed descriptions of Amazon EC2 instance types.
            fleet-type: Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, this property is set to `ON_DEMAND`. Learn more about when to use [On-Demand versus Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-ec2-instances.html#gamelift-ec2-instances-spot).

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            instance-role-arn: A unique identifier for an IAM role that manages access to your Amazon Web Services services. With an instance role ARN set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). Create a role or look up a role's ARN by using the [IAM dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. Learn more about using on-box credentials for your game servers at [Access external resources from a game server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-resources.html). This fleet property can't be changed after the fleet is created.
            instance-role-credentials-provider: Prompts Amazon GameLift Servers to generate a shared credentials file for the IAM role that's defined in `InstanceRoleArn`. The shared credentials file is stored on each fleet instance and refreshed as needed. Use shared credentials for applications that are deployed along with the game server executable, if the game server is integrated with server SDK version 5.x. For more information about using shared credentials, see [Communicate with other Amazon Web Services resources from your fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-resources.html).
            locations: A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as a multi-location fleet. Use this parameter when creating a fleet in Amazon Web Services Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any Amazon Web Services Region or Local Zone that's supported by Amazon GameLift Servers. Provide a list of one or more Amazon Web Services Region codes, such as `us-west-2`, or Local Zone names. When using this parameter, Amazon GameLift Servers requires you to include your home location in the request. For a list of supported Regions and Local Zones, see [Amazon GameLift Servers service locations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html) for managed hosting.
            log-paths: '**This parameter is no longer used.** To specify where Amazon GameLift Servers should store log files once a server process shuts down, use the Amazon GameLift Servers server API `ProcessReady()` and specify one or more directory paths in `logParameters`. For more information, see [Initialize the server process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-initialize) in the *Amazon GameLift Servers Developer Guide*.'
            metric-groups: The name of an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time.
            name: A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
            new-game-session-protection-policy: |-
                The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, this property is set to `NoProtection`. You can also set game session protection for an individual game session by calling [UpdateGameSession](gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateGameSession.html).

                - **NoProtection** - Game sessions can be terminated during active gameplay as a result of a scale-down event.
                - **FullProtection** - Game sessions in `ACTIVE` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
            peer-vpc-aws-account-id: Used when peering your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet with a VPC, the unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the VPC. You can find your account ID in the Amazon Web Services Management Console under account settings.
            peer-vpc-id: A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/) in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Servers Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html).
            resource-creation-limit-policy: A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time.
            runtime-configuration: |-
                Instructions for how to launch and run server processes on the fleet. Set runtime configuration for managed EC2 fleets. For an Anywhere fleets, set this parameter only if the fleet is running the Amazon GameLift Servers Agent. The runtime configuration defines one or more server process configurations. Each server process identifies a game executable or Realtime script file and the number of processes to run concurrently.

                This parameter replaces the parameters `ServerLaunchPath` and `ServerLaunchParameters`, which are still supported for backward compatibility.
            script-id: The unique identifier for a Realtime configuration script to be deployed to a fleet with compute type `EC2`. You can use either the script ID or ARN. Scripts must be uploaded to Amazon GameLift Servers prior to creating the fleet. This fleet property can't be changed after the fleet is created.
            server-launch-parameters: '**This parameter is no longer used.** Specify server launch parameters using the `RuntimeConfiguration` parameter. Requests that use this parameter instead continue to be valid.'

            Retrieves core fleet-wide properties for fleets in an Amazon Web Services Region. Properties include the computing hardware and deployment configuration for instances in the fleet.

            You can use this operation in the following ways:

            - To get attributes for specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.
            - To get attributes for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

            When requesting attributes for multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

            If successful, a `FleetAttributes` object is returned for each fleet requested, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

            Some API operations limit the number of fleet IDs that allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message contains the maximum allowed number.

            Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with [StopFleetActions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StopFleetActions.html). For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.

            This operation can be used in the following ways:

            - To restart actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to resume.
            - To restart actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to resume.

            If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet's scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location were never stopped, this operation will have no effect.

            **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2 (FleetIQ)

            Updates information about a registered game server to help Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ track game server availability. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group.

            Use this operation to update the following types of game server information. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:

            - To update the game server's utilization status from `AVAILABLE` (when the game server is available to be claimed) to `UTILIZED` (when the game server is currently hosting games). Identify the game server and game server group and specify the new utilization status. You can't change the status from to `UTILIZED` to `AVAILABLE` .
            - To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to `HEALTHY`. If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.
            - To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.

            Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.

Use this operation to define how to deploy a container architecture onto each fleet instance and configure fleet settings. You can create a container fleet in any Amazon Web Services Regions that Amazon GameLift Servers supports for multi-location fleets. A container fleet can be deployed to a single location or multiple locations. Container fleets are deployed with Amazon Linux 2023 as the instance operating system.\n\nDefine the fleet's container architecture using container group definitions. Each fleet can have one of the following container group types:\n\n- The game server container group runs your game server build and dependent software. Amazon GameLift Servers deploys one or more replicas of this container group to each fleet instance. The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use.\n- An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.\n\nEach container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.\n\n**Request options**\n\nUse this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.\n\n- Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later. In this scenario, no fleet instances are deployed, and the fleet can't host game sessions until you add a game server container group definition. Provide the following required parameter values:\n  \n  - `FleetRoleArn`\n- Create a fleet with a game server container group. Provide the following required parameter values:\n  \n  - `FleetRoleArn`\n  - `GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName`\n- Create a fleet with a game server container group and a per-instance container group. Provide the following required parameter values:\n  \n  - `FleetRoleArn`\n  - `GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName`\n  - `PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName`\n\n**Results**\n\nIf successful, this operation creates a new container fleet resource, places it in `PENDING` status, and initiates the [fleet creation workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-all.html#fleets-creation-workflow). For fleets with container groups, this workflow starts a fleet deployment and transitions the status to `ACTIVE`. Fleets without a container group are placed in `CREATED` status.\n\nYou can update most of the properties of a fleet, including container group definitions, and deploy the update across all fleet instances. Use [UpdateContainerFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateContainerFleet.html) to deploy a new game server version update across the container fleet.\n\nA managed fleet's runtime environment depends on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) version it uses. When a new fleet is created, Amazon GameLift Servers assigns the latest available AMI version to the fleet, and all compute instances in that fleet are deployed with that version. To update the AMI version, you must create a new fleet. As a best practice, we recommend replacing your managed fleets every 30 days to maintain a secure and up-to-date runtime environment for your hosted game servers.

            game-server-container-groups-per-instance: |-
                The number of times to replicate the game server container group on each fleet instance.

                By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates the maximum number of game server container groups that can fit on each instance. This calculation is based on the CPU and memory resources of the fleet's instance type). To use the calculated maximum, don't set this parameter. If you set this number manually, Amazon GameLift Servers uses your value as long as it's less than the calculated maximum.

            instance-connection-port-range: |-
                The set of port numbers to open on each fleet instance. A fleet's connection ports map to container ports that are configured in the fleet's container group definitions.

                By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates an optimal port range based on your fleet configuration. To use the calculated range, don't set this parameter. The values are:

                - Port range: 4192 to a number calculated based on your fleet configuration. Amazon GameLift Servers uses the following formula: `4192 + [# of game server container groups per fleet instance] * [# of container ports in the game server container group definition] + [# of container ports in the game server container group definition]`

                You can also choose to manually set this parameter. When manually setting this parameter, you must use port numbers that match the fleet's inbound permissions port range.

                If you set values manually, Amazon GameLift Servers no longer calculates a port range for you, even if you later remove the manual settings.
            instance-inbound-permissions: |-
                The IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game server processes and other processes on this fleet. As a best practice, when remotely accessing a fleet instance, we recommend opening ports only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.

                By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates an optimal port range based on your fleet configuration. To use the calculated range, don't set this parameter. The values are:

                - Protocol: UDP
                - Port range: 4192 to a number calculated based on your fleet configuration. Amazon GameLift Servers uses the following formula: `4192 + [# of game server container groups per fleet instance] * [# of container ports in the game server container group definition] + [# of container ports in the game server container group definition]`

                You can also choose to manually set this parameter. When manually setting this parameter, you must use port numbers that match the fleet's connection port range.

                If you set values manually, Amazon GameLift Servers no longer calculates a port range for you, even if you later remove the manual settings.
            instance-type: |-
                The Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all instances in the fleet. For multi-location fleets, the instance type must be available in the home region and all remote locations. Instance type determines the computing resources and processing power that's available to host your game servers. This includes including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

                By default, Amazon GameLift Servers selects an instance type that fits the needs of your container groups and is available in all selected fleet locations. You can also choose to manually set this parameter. See [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for detailed descriptions of Amazon EC2 instance types.

                You can't update this fleet property later.
            locations: A set of locations to deploy container fleet instances to. You can add any Amazon Web Services Region or Local Zone that's supported by Amazon GameLift Servers. Provide a list of one or more Amazon Web Services Region codes, such as `us-west-2`, or Local Zone names. Also include the fleet's home Region, which is the Amazon Web Services Region where the fleet is created. For a list of supported Regions and Local Zones, see [Amazon GameLift Servers service locations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html) for managed hosting.
            log-configuration: |-
                A method for collecting container logs for the fleet. Amazon GameLift Servers saves all standard output for each container in logs, including game session logs. You can select from the following methods:

                - `CLOUDWATCH` -- Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch log group that you define. Each container emits a log stream, which is organized in the log group.
                - `S3` -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define.
                - `NONE` -- Don't collect container logs.

                By default, this property is set to `CLOUDWATCH`.

                Amazon GameLift Servers requires permissions to send logs other Amazon Web Services services in your account. These permissions are included in the IAM fleet role for this container fleet (see `FleetRoleArn)`.
            metric-groups: The name of an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. You can use a metric group to aggregate metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or use a new name to create a new metric group. Each fleet can have only one metric group, but you can change this value at any time.
            new-game-session-protection-policy: |-
                Determines whether Amazon GameLift Servers can shut down game sessions on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift Servers might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session protection for individual game sessions using [UpdateGameSession](gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateGameSession.html).

                - **NoProtection** -- Game sessions can be shut down during active gameplay.
                - **FullProtection** -- Game sessions in `ACTIVE` status can't be shut down.

                By default, this property is set to `NoProtection`.
            per-instance-container-group-definition-name: |-
                The name of a container group definition resource that describes a set of axillary software. A fleet instance has one process for executables in this container group. A per-instance container group is optional. You can update the fleet to add or remove a per-instance container group at any time. You can specify the container group definition's name to use the latest version. Alternatively, provide an ARN value with a specific version number.

                Create a container group definition by calling [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API\_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html).

        command: "**This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container\n\nMakes a request to start a new game session using a game session queue. When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift Servers looks for the best possible available resource to host the game session, based on how the queue is configured to prioritize factors such as resource cost, latency, and location. After selecting an available resource, Amazon GameLift Servers prompts the resource to start a game session. A placement request can include a list of players to create a set of player sessions. The request can also include information to pass to the new game session, such as to specify a game map or other options.\n\n**Request options**\n\nUse this operation to make the following types of requests.\n\n- Request a placement using the queue's default prioritization process (see the default prioritization described in [PriorityConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html)). Include these required parameters:\n  \n  - `GameSessionQueueName`\n  - `MaximumPlayerSessionCount`\n  - `PlacementID`\n- Request a placement and prioritize based on latency. Include these parameters:\n  \n  - Required parameters `GameSessionQueueName`, `MaximumPlayerSessionCount`, `PlacementID`.\n  - `PlayerLatencies`. Include a set of latency values for destinations in the queue. When a request includes latency data, Amazon GameLift Servers automatically reorder the queue's locations priority list based on lowest available latency values. If a request includes latency data for multiple players, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates each location's average latency for all players and reorders to find the lowest latency across all players.\n  - Don't include `PriorityConfigurationOverride`.\n  \n  <!--THE END-->\n  \n  - Prioritize based on a custom list of locations. If you're using a queue that's configured to prioritize location first (see [PriorityConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html) for game session queues), you can optionally use the *PriorityConfigurationOverride* parameter to substitute a different location priority list for this placement request. Amazon GameLift Servers searches each location on the priority override list to find an available hosting resource for the new game session. Specify a fallback strategy to use in the event that Amazon GameLift Servers fails to place the game session in any of the locations on the override list.\n- Request a placement and prioritized based on a custom list of locations.\n- You can request new player sessions for a group of players. Include the *DesiredPlayerSessions* parameter and include at minimum a unique player ID for each. You can also include player-specific data to pass to the new game session.\n\n**Result**\n\nIf successful, this operation generates a new game session placement request and adds it to the game session queue for processing. You can track the status of individual placement requests by calling [DescribeGameSessionPlacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessionPlacement.html) or by monitoring queue notifications. When the request status is `FULFILLED`, a new game session has started and the placement request is updated with connection information for the game session (IP address and port). If the request included player session data, Amazon GameLift Servers creates a player session for each player ID in the request.\n\nThe request results in a `InvalidRequestException` in the following situations:\n\n- If the request includes both *PlayerLatencies* and *PriorityConfigurationOverride* parameters.\n- If the request includes the *PriorityConfigurationOverride* parameter and specifies a queue that doesn't prioritize locations.\n\nAmazon GameLift Servers continues to retry each placement request until it reaches the queue's timeout setting. If a request times out, you can resubmit the request to the same queue or try a different queue."

            Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in `ACTIVE` status and has a player creation policy of `ACCEPT_ALL`. You can add a group of players to a game session with [CreatePlayerSessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSessions.html) .

            To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set of player data.

            If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new `PlayerSessions` object is returned with a player session ID. The player references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the Amazon GameLift Servers service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

            The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable.

            Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record. You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:

            - The game server group
            - The corresponding Auto Scaling group
            - All game servers that are currently running in the group

            To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in `ACTIVE` or `ERROR` status.

            If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to `DELETE_SCHEDULED`, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in `ERROR` status.

            Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.

            Temporarily stops activity on a game server group without terminating instances or the game server group. You can restart activity by calling [ResumeGameServerGroup](gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ResumeGameServerGroup.html). You can suspend the following activity:

            - **Instance type replacement** - This activity evaluates the current game hosting viability of all Spot instance types that are defined for the game server group. It updates the Auto Scaling group to remove nonviable Spot Instance types, which have a higher chance of game server interruptions. It then balances capacity across the remaining viable Spot Instance types. When this activity is suspended, the Auto Scaling group continues with its current balance, regardless of viability. Instance protection, utilization metrics, and capacity scaling activities continue to be active.

            To suspend activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of activity to be suspended. If successful, a `GameServerGroup` object is returned showing that the activity is listed in `SuspendedActions`.

            Updates properties in an existing container group definition. This operation doesn't replace the definition. Instead, it creates a new version of the definition and saves it separately. You can access all versions that you choose to retain.

            The only property you can't update is the container group type.

            **Request options:**

            - Update based on the latest version of the container group definition. Specify the container group definition name only, or use an ARN value without a version number. Provide updated values for the properties that you want to change only. All other values remain the same as the latest version.
            - Update based on a specific version of the container group definition. Specify the container group definition name and a source version number, or use an ARN value with a version number. Provide updated values for the properties that you want to change only. All other values remain the same as the source version.
            - Change a game server container definition. Provide the updated container definition.
            - Add or change a support container definition. Provide a complete set of container definitions, including the updated definition.
            - Remove a support container definition. Provide a complete set of container definitions, excluding the definition to remove. If the container group has only one support container definition, provide an empty set.

            If successful, this operation returns the complete properties of the new container group definition version.

            Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.

            When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in each ticket. Calls to this action are only valid for tickets that are in this status; calls for tickets not in this status result in an error.

            To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, one or more players, and an acceptance response. When all players have accepted, Amazon GameLift Servers advances the matchmaking tickets to status `PLACING`, and attempts to create a new game session for the match.

            If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. Each matchmaking ticket in the failed match is handled as follows:

            - If the ticket has one or more players who rejected the match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set `CANCELLED` and processing is terminated.
            - If all players in the ticket accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to `SEARCHING` to find a new match.

            Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in `CLAIMED` status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.

            To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. Add filter options to further restrict how a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on `ACTIVE` instances to be claimed.

            When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains `AVAILABLE` while the claim status is set to `CLAIMED` for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to `UTILIZED` after players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.

            If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:

            - If the game server utilization status is `UTILIZED`.
            - If the game server claim status is `CLAIMED`.
            - If the game server is running on an instance in `DRAINING` status and the provided filter option does not allow placing on `DRAINING` instances.
