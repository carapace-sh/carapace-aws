                If you specifiy `ALL_MATCHED`, Amazon Fraud Detector evaluates all rules and returns the outcomes for all matched rules. You can define and edit the rule mode at the detector version level, when it is in draft status.

                The default behavior is `FIRST_MATCHED`.

                You must provide at least one eventVariable

                To ensure most accurate fraud prediction and to simplify your data preparation, Amazon Fraud Detector will replace all missing variables or values as follows:

                **For Amazon Fraud Detector trained models:**

                If a null value is provided explicitly for a variable or if a variable is missing, model will replace the null value or the missing variable (no variable name in the eventVariables map) with calculated default mean/medians for numeric variables and with special values for categorical variables.

                **For imported SageMaker models:**

                If a null value is provided explicitly for a variable, the model and rules will use “null” as the value. If a variable is not provided (no variable name in the eventVariables map), model and rules will use the default value that is provided for the variable.

                If you specify `FIRST_MATCHED`, Amazon Fraud Detector evaluates rules sequentially, first to last, stopping at the first matched rule. Amazon Fraud dectector then provides the outcomes for that single rule.
