                The local resources to monitor. A local resource in a workload is the location of the host, or hosts, where the Network Flow Monitor agent is installed. For example, if a workload consists of an interaction between a web service and a backend database (for example, Amazon Dynamo DB), the subnet with the EC2 instance that hosts the web service, which also runs the agent, is the local resource.

                The remote resources to monitor. A remote resource is the other endpoint in the bi-directional flow of a workload, with a local resource. For example, Amazon Dynamo DB can be a remote resource.

                When you specify remote resources, be aware that specific combinations of resources are allowed and others are not, including the following constraints:

                - All remote resources that you specify must all belong to a single Region.
                - If you specify Amazon Web Services services as remote resources, any other remote resources that you specify must be in the current Region.
                - When you specify a remote resource for another Region, you can only specify the `Region` resource type. You cannot specify a subnet, VPC, or Availability Zone in another Region.
                - If you leave the `RemoteResources` parameter empty, the monitor will include all network flows that terminate in the current Region.
            scope-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scope for the monitor.
            tags: The tags for a monitor. You can add a maximum of 200 tags.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            In Network Flow Monitor, you specify a scope for the service to generate metrics for. By using the scope, Network Flow Monitor can generate a topology of all the resources to measure performance metrics for. When you create a scope, you enable permissions for Network Flow Monitor.

            A scope is a Region-account pair or multiple Region-account pairs. Network Flow Monitor uses your scope to determine all the resources (the topology) where Network Flow Monitor will gather network flow performance metrics for you. To provide performance metrics, Network Flow Monitor uses the data that is sent by the Network Flow Monitor agents you install on the resources.

            To define the Region-account pairs for your scope, the Network Flow Monitor API uses the following constucts, which allow for future flexibility in defining scopes:

            - *Targets*, which are arrays of targetResources.
            - *Target resources*, which are Region-targetIdentifier pairs.
            - *Target identifiers*, made up of a targetID (currently always an account ID) and a targetType (currently always an account).

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

            max-results: The number of query results that you want to return with this call.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            query-id: The identifier for the query. A query ID is an internally-generated identifier for a specific query returned from an API call to create a query.
            scope-id: The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to get data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated identifier that includes all the resources for a specific root account.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Return the data for a query with the Network Flow Monitor query interface. Specify the query that you want to return results for by providing a query ID and a monitor name. This query returns the top contributors for workload insights.

            When you start a query, use this call to check the status of the query to make sure that it has has `SUCCEEDED` before you review the results. Use the same query ID that you used for the corresponding API call to start the query, `StartQueryWorkloadInsightsTopContributors`.

            Top contributors in Network Flow Monitor are network flows with the highest values for a specific metric type. Top contributors can be across all workload insights, for a given scope, or for a specific monitor. Use the applicable call for the top contributors that you want to be returned.
