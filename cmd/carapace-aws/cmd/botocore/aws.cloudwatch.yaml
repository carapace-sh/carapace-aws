        command: |-
            Creates or updates a *composite alarm*. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.

            The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a composite alarm can include as many as 100 underlying alarms. Any single alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as many as 150 composite alarms.

            Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.

            Composite alarms can take the following actions:

            - Notify Amazon SNS topics.
            - Invoke Lambda functions.
            - Create OpsItems in Systems Manager Ops Center.
            - Create incidents in Systems Manager Incident Manager.

            It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

            To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the `AlarmRule` of one of the alarms to `false`.

            Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

            When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

            When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

            To use this operation, you must be signed on with the `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission that is scoped to `*`. You can't create a composite alarms if your `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission has a narrower scope.

            If you are an IAM user, you must have `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` to create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.
        flag:
            actions-enabled: Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state of the composite alarm. The default is `TRUE`.
            actions-suppressor: Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the `ALARM` state. `ActionsSuppressor` can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from an existing alarm.

            alarm-rule: |-
                An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression.

                You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated.

                Functions can include the following:

                - `ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state.
                - `OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state.
                - `INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state.
                - `TRUE` always evaluates to TRUE.
                - `FALSE` always evaluates to FALSE.

                TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex `AlarmRule` structure, and for testing your alarm actions.

                Alarm names specified in `AlarmRule` can be surrounded with double-quotes ("), but do not have to be.

                The following are some examples of `AlarmRule`:

                - `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)` specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state.
                - `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)` specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment window.
                - `(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)` goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring.

                The `AlarmRule` can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The `AlarmRule` expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.

            You can use the `GetMetricWidgetImage` API to retrieve a snapshot graph of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as a bitmap image. You can then embed this image into your services and products, such as wiki pages, reports, and documents. You could also retrieve images regularly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.

            The graph you retrieve can include all CloudWatch metric graph features, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.

            There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each `GetMetricWidgetImage` action has the following limits:

            - As many as 100 metrics in the graph.
            - Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.

                The format of the resulting image. Only PNG images are supported.

                The default is `png`. If you specify `png`, the API returns an HTTP response with the content-type set to `text/xml`. The image data is in a `MetricWidgetImage` field. For example:

                `<GetMetricWidgetImageResponse xmlns=<URLstring>>`

                `<GetMetricWidgetImageResult>`

                `<MetricWidgetImage>`

                `</ResponseMetadata>`

                `</GetMetricWidgetImageResponse>`

                The `image/png` setting is intended only for custom HTTP requests. For most use cases, and all actions using an Amazon Web Services SDK, you should use `png`. If you specify `image/png`, the HTTP response has a content-type set to `image/png`, and the body of the response is a PNG image.

            When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

            If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:

            - The `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission for all alarms with EC2 actions
            - The `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permissions to create an alarm with Systems Manager OpsItem or response plan actions.

            The first time you create an alarm in the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked roles are called `AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents` and `AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchAlarms_ActionSSM`. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role).

            Each `PutMetricAlarm` action has a maximum uncompressed payload of 120 KB.

            **Cross-account alarms**

            You can set an alarm on metrics in the current account, or in another account. To create a cross-account alarm that watches a metric in a different account, you must have completed the following pre-requisites:

            - The account where the metrics are located (the *sharing account*) must already have a sharing role named **CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole**. If it does not already have this role, you must create it using the instructions in **Set up a sharing account** in [Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html#enable-cross-account-cross-Region). The policy for that role must grant access to the ID of the account where you are creating the alarm.
            - The account where you are creating the alarm (the *monitoring account*) must already have a service-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount** to allow CloudWatch to assume the sharing role in the sharing account. If it does not, you must create it following the directions in **Set up a monitoring account** in [Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html#enable-cross-account-cross-Region).

                The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

                The values `LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold`, `LessThanLowerThreshold`, and `GreaterThanUpperThreshold` are used only for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
            datapoints-to-alarm: The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M. For more information, see [Evaluating an Alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.
            dimensions: The dimensions for the metric specified in `MetricName`.
            evaluate-low-sample-count-percentile: |-
                Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify `ignore`, the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If you specify `evaluate` or omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more information, see [Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#percentiles-with-low-samples).

            evaluation-periods: The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N.
            extended-statistic: |-
                The extended statistic for the metric specified in `MetricName`. When you call `PutMetricAlarm` and specify a `MetricName`, you must specify either `Statistic` or `ExtendedStatistic` but not both.

                If you specify `ExtendedStatistic`, the following are valid values:

                - `p90`
                - `tm90`
                - `tc90`

            metric-name: |-
                The name for the metric associated with the alarm. For each `PutMetricAlarm` operation, you must specify either `MetricName` or a `Metrics` array.

                If you are creating an alarm based on a math expression, you cannot specify this parameter, or any of the `Namespace`, `Dimensions`, `Period`, `Unit`, `Statistic`, or `ExtendedStatistic` parameters. Instead, you specify all this information in the `Metrics` array.
            metrics: |-
                An array of `MetricDataQuery` structures that enable you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. For each `PutMetricAlarm` operation, you must specify either `MetricName` or a `Metrics` array.

                Each item in the `Metrics` array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression.

                One item in the `Metrics` array is the expression that the alarm watches. You designate this expression by setting `ReturnData` to true for this object in the array. For more information, see [MetricDataQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDataQuery.html).

                If you use the `Metrics` parameter, you cannot include the `Namespace`, `MetricName`, `Dimensions`, `Period`, `Unit`, `Statistic`, or `ExtendedStatistic` parameters of `PutMetricAlarm` in the same operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your math expression as part of the `Metrics` array.
            namespace: The namespace for the metric associated specified in `MetricName`.
            ok-actions: |-
                The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to an `OK` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Valid values:

                **EC2 actions:**

                - `arn:aws:automate:region:ec2:stop`
                - `arn:aws:automate:region:ec2:terminate`
                - `arn:aws:automate:region:ec2:reboot`

                - `arn:aws:swf:region:account-id:action/actions/AWS_EC2.InstanceId.Stop/1.0`
                - `arn:aws:swf:region:account-id:action/actions/AWS_EC2.InstanceId.Terminate/1.0`
                - `arn:aws:swf:region:account-id:action/actions/AWS_EC2.InstanceId.Reboot/1.0`
                - `arn:aws:swf:region:account-id:action/actions/AWS_EC2.InstanceId.Recover/1.0`

                **Autoscaling action:**

                - `arn:aws:autoscaling:region:account-id:scalingPolicy:policy-id:autoScalingGroupName/group-friendly-name:policyName/policy-friendly-name`

                **Lambda actions:**

                - Invoke the latest version of a Lambda function: `arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name`
                - Invoke a specific version of a Lambda function: `arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name:version-number`
                - Invoke a function by using an alias Lambda function: `arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name:alias-name`

                **SNS notification action:**

                - `arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:sns-topic-name`

                **SSM integration actions:**

                - `arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:opsitem:severity#CATEGORY=category-name`
                - `arn:aws:ssm-incidents::account-id:responseplan/response-plan-name`
            period: |-
                The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in `MetricName` is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 20, 30, and any multiple of 60.

                `Period` is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the `Metrics` array.

                Be sure to specify 10, 20, or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a `PutMetricData` call with a `StorageResolution` of 1. If you specify a period of 10, 20, or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT\_DATA status. Specifying 10, 20, or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

                An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than seven days, so `Period` multiplied by `EvaluationPeriods` can't be more than 604,800 seconds. For alarms with a period of less than one hour (3,600 seconds), the total evaluation period can't be longer than one day (86,400 seconds).
            statistic: The statistic for the metric specified in `MetricName`, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use `ExtendedStatistic`. When you call `PutMetricAlarm` and specify a `MetricName`, you must specify either `Statistic` or `ExtendedStatistic,` but not both.
            tags: |-
                A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm. To be able to associate tags with the alarm when you create the alarm, you must have the `cloudwatch:TagResource` permission.

                Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

                If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) or [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html).

                To use this field to set tags for an alarm when you create it, you must be signed on with both the `cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm` and `cloudwatch:TagResource` permissions.
            threshold: |-
                The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

                This parameter is required for alarms based on static thresholds, but should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
            threshold-metric-id: |-
                If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this value match the ID of the `ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND` function.

                For an example of how to use this parameter, see the **Anomaly Detection Model Alarm** example on this page.

                If your alarm uses this parameter, it cannot have Auto Scaling actions.
            treat-missing-data: |-
                Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If `TreatMissingData` is omitted, the default behavior of `missing` is used. For more information, see [Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data).

                Valid Values: `breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing`

                Alarms that evaluate metrics in the `AWS/DynamoDB` namespace always `ignore` missing data even if you choose a different option for `TreatMissingData`. When an `AWS/DynamoDB` metric has missing data, alarms that evaluate that metric remain in their current state.
            unit: |-
                The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you can specify the unit for each metric (if needed) within the objects in the `Metrics` array.

                If you don't specify `Unit`, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended.

                However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves unpredictably.

                We recommend omitting `Unit` so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so causes the alarm to be stuck in the `INSUFFICIENT DATA` state.

        command: |-
            Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes. When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action configured for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your alarm is configured to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is triggered, temporarily changing the alarm state to `ALARM` sends an SNS message.

            Metric alarms returns to their actual state quickly, often within seconds. Because the metric alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically only visible in the alarm's **History** tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console or through [DescribeAlarmHistory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarmHistory.html).

            If you use `SetAlarmState` on a composite alarm, the composite alarm is not guaranteed to return to its actual state. It returns to its actual state only once any of its children alarms change state. It is also reevaluated if you update its configuration.

            If an alarm triggers EC2 Auto Scaling policies or application Auto Scaling policies, you must include information in the `StateReasonData` parameter to enable the policy to take the correct action.

            Creates or updates a metric stream. Metric streams can automatically stream CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Web Services destinations, including Amazon S3, and to many third-party solutions.

            For more information, see [Using Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html).

            To create a metric stream, you must be signed in to an account that has the `iam:PassRole` permission and either the `CloudWatchFullAccess` policy or the `cloudwatch:PutMetricStream` permission.

            When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:

            - Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.
            - Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in `ExcludeFilters`.
            - Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in `IncludeFilters`.

            By default, a metric stream always sends the `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, and `SAMPLECOUNT` statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use the `StatisticsConfigurations` parameter to have the metric stream send additional statistics in the stream. Streaming additional statistics incurs additional costs. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

            When you use `PutMetricStream` to create a new metric stream, the stream is created in the `running` state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the state of the stream is not changed.

            If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability and you create a metric stream in a monitoring account, you can choose whether to include metrics from source accounts in the stream. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html).

                By default, a metric stream always sends the `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, and `SAMPLECOUNT` statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use this parameter to have the metric stream also send additional statistics in the stream. This array can have up to 100 members.

                For each entry in this array, you specify one or more metrics and the list of additional statistics to stream for those metrics. The additional statistics that you can stream depend on the stream's `OutputFormat`. If the `OutputFormat` is `json`, you can stream any additional statistic that is supported by CloudWatch, listed in [CloudWatch statistics definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html). If the `OutputFormat` is `opentelemetry1.0` or `opentelemetry0.7`, you can stream percentile statistics such as p95, p99.9, and so on.

                You can use this parameter only when you are creating a new metric stream. If you are using this operation to update an existing metric stream, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored.

            Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation.

            If you specify any incorrect alarm names, the alarms you specify with correct names are still deleted. Other syntax errors might result in no alarms being deleted. To confirm that alarms were deleted successfully, you can use the [DescribeAlarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarms.html) operation after using `DeleteAlarms`.

            It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

            To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the `AlarmRule` of one of the alarms to `false`.

            Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

        command: |-
            Gets statistics for the specified metric.

            The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.

            CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.

            CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

            - The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.
            - The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.

            Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

            Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

            - Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a `StorageResolution` of 1.
            - Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.
            - Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.
            - Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).

            Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

            CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric. If a specific combination of dimensions was not published, you can't retrieve statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created. For an example, see [Dimension Combinations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#dimension-combinations) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

            extended-statistics: The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100.

            period: |-
                The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that includes a `StorageResolution` of 1 second.

                If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

                - Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).
                - Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
                - Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
            start-time: |-
                The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request.

                The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).

                CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

                - Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
                - Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.
                - Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.

                If you set `Period` to 5, 10, 20, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, 20-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.
            statistics: The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use `ExtendedStatistics`. When calling `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both.
            unit: The unit for a given metric. If you omit `Unit`, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

When you enable a managed rule, you create a Contributor Insights rule that collects data from Amazon Web Services services. You cannot edit these rules with `PutInsightRule`. The rules can be enabled, disabled, and deleted using `EnableInsightRules`, `DisableInsightRules`, and `DeleteInsightRules`. If a previously created managed rule is currently disabled, a subsequent call to this API will re-enable it. Use `ListManagedInsightRules` to describe all available rules.

            Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource. Currently, the only CloudWatch resources that can be tagged are alarms and Contributor Insights rules.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the `TagResource` action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.

        command: |-
            Publishes metric data to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the data with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to [ListMetrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_ListMetrics.html).

            You can publish metrics with associated entity data (so that related telemetry can be found and viewed together), or publish metric data by itself. To send entity data with your metrics, use the `EntityMetricData` parameter. To send metrics without entity data, use the `MetricData` parameter. The `EntityMetricData` structure includes `MetricData` structures for the metric data.

            You can publish either individual values in the `Value` field, or arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using the `Values` and `Counts` fields in the `MetricData` structure. Using the `Values` and `Counts` method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one `PutMetricData` request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.

            Each `PutMetricData` request is limited to 1 MB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 1000 different metrics (across both the `MetricData` and `EntityMetricData` properties).

            Although the `Value` parameter accepts numbers of type `Double`, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.

            You can use up to 30 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. Each dimension consists of a Name and Value pair. For more information about specifying dimensions, see [Publishing Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

            You specify the time stamp to be associated with each data point. You can specify time stamps that are as much as two weeks before the current date, and as much as 2 hours after the current day and time.

            Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) or [GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html) from the time they are submitted. Data points with time stamps between 3 and 24 hours ago can take as much as 2 hours to become available for [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) or [GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html).

            CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

            - The `SampleCount` value of the statistic set is 1 and `Min`, `Max`, and `Sum` are all equal.
            - The `Min` and `Max` are equal, and `Sum` is equal to `Min` multiplied by `SampleCount`.

            You can use the `GetMetricData` API to retrieve CloudWatch metric values. The operation can also include a CloudWatch Metrics Insights query, and one or more metric math functions.

            A `GetMetricData` operation that does not include a query can retrieve as many as 500 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform metric math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

            If you include a Metrics Insights query, each `GetMetricData` operation can include only one query. But the same `GetMetricData` operation can also retrieve other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent three hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see [Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/query_with_cloudwatch-metrics-insights.html).

            Calls to the `GetMetricData` API have a different pricing structure than calls to `GetMetricStatistics`. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

            Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

            - Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a `StorageResolution` of 1.
            - Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.
            - Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.
            - Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).

            Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

            If you omit `Unit` in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            **Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math**

            You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same expression, but you can reference results from a Metrics Insights query within other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a **GROUP BY** clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects a single time series. A Metrics Insights query with a **GROUP BY** clause returns an array of time-series (TS\[]), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects an array of time series.

For example, if the `Period` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as `EndTime` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the `EndTime`.

                If you omit this parameter, the default of `TimestampDescending` is used.
            start-time: |-
                The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

                The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp.

                CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

                - Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
                - Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.
                - Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.

                If you set `Period` to 5, 10, 20, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, 20-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.

                For better performance, specify `StartTime` and `EndTime` values that align with the value of the metric's `Period` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the `Period` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as `StartTime` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the `StartTime`.

            All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

            A simple way to create a dashboard using `PutDashboard` is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use `GetDashboard`, and then use the data returned within `DashboardBody` as the template for the new dashboard when you call `PutDashboard`.

            When you create a dashboard with `PutDashboard`, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the `DashboardBody` script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

                Retrieves the specified alarms. You can filter the results by specifying a prefix for the alarm name, the alarm state, or a prefix for any action.

                To use this operation and return information about composite alarms, you must be signed on with the `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` permission that is scoped to `*`. You can't return information about composite alarms if your `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` permission has a narrower scope.

                    If you use this parameter and specify the name of a composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "children" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the metric alarms and composite alarms referenced in the `AlarmRule` field of the composite alarm that you specify in `ChildrenOfAlarmName`. Information about the composite alarm that you name in `ChildrenOfAlarmName` is not returned.

                    If you specify `ChildrenOfAlarmName`, you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for `MaxRecords` and `NextToken`. If you do so, you receive a validation error.

                    Only the `Alarm Name`, `ARN`, `StateValue` (OK/ALARM/INSUFFICIENT\_DATA), and `StateUpdatedTimestamp` information are returned by this operation when you use this parameter. To get complete information about these alarms, perform another `DescribeAlarms` operation and specify the parent alarm names in the `AlarmNames` parameter.
