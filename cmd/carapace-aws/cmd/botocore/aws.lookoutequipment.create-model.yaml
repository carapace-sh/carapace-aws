description: Creates a machine learning model for data inference.
flags:
    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided
    --client-token=!: A unique identifier for the request.
    --data-pre-processing-configuration=: The configuration is the `TargetSamplingRate`, which is the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
    --dataset-name=!: The name of the dataset for the machine learning model being created.
    --dataset-schema=: The data schema for the machine learning model being created.
    --evaluation-data-end-time=: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to end the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.
    --evaluation-data-start-time=: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to begin the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request
