description: Creates a machine learning model for data inference.
flags:
    --client-token=!: A unique identifier for the request.
    --data-pre-processing-configuration=: The configuration is the `TargetSamplingRate`, which is the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
    --dataset-name=!: The name of the dataset for the machine learning model being created.
    --dataset-schema=: The data schema for the machine learning model being created.
    --evaluation-data-end-time=: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to end the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.
    --evaluation-data-start-time=: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to begin the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.
    --labels-input-configuration=: The input configuration for the labels being used for the machine learning model that's being created.
    --model-diagnostics-output-configuration=: The Amazon S3 location where you want Amazon Lookout for Equipment to save the pointwise model diagnostics.
    --model-name=!: The name for the machine learning model to be created.
    --off-condition=: Indicates that the asset associated with this sensor has been shut off.
    --role-arn=: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access the data source being used to create the machine learning model.
    --server-side-kms-key-id=: Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt model data by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
    --tags=: Any tags associated with the machine learning model being created.
    --training-data-end-time=: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to end the subset of training data for the machine learning model.
    --training-data-start-time=: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to begin the subset of training data for the machine learning model.
