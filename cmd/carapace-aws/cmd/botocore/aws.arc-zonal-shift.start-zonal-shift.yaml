description: You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away from an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.
flags:
    --away-from=!: The Availability Zone (for example, `use1-az1`) that traffic is moved away from for a resource when you start a zonal shift.
    --comment=!: A comment that you enter about the zonal shift.
    --expires-in=!: The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time).
    --resource-identifier=!: The identifier for the resource that Amazon Web Services shifts traffic for.
