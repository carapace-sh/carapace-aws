            Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified pipe. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the `TagResource` action with a pipe that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the pipe. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the pipe, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a pipe.

            Update an existing pipe. When you call `UpdatePipe`, EventBridge only the updates fields you have specified in the request; the rest remain unchanged. The exception to this is if you modify any Amazon Web Services-service specific fields in the `SourceParameters`, `EnrichmentParameters`, or `TargetParameters` objects. For example, `DynamoDBStreamParameters` or `EventBridgeEventBusParameters`. EventBridge updates the fields in these objects atomically as one and overrides existing values. This is by design, and means that if you don't specify an optional field in one of these `Parameters` objects, EventBridge sets that field to its system-default value during the update.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

            kms-key-identifier: |-
                The identifier of the KMS customer managed key for EventBridge to use, if you choose to use a customer managed key to encrypt pipe data. The identifier can be the key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KeyId, key alias, or key alias ARN.

                To update a pipe that is using the default Amazon Web Services owned key to use a customer managed key instead, or update a pipe that is using a customer managed key to use a different customer managed key, specify a customer managed key identifier.

                To update a pipe that is using a customer managed key to use the default Amazon Web Services owned key, specify an empty string.

            log-configuration: The logging configuration settings for the pipe.
            name: The name of the pipe.
            role-arn: The ARN of the role that allows the pipe to send data to the target.
            source-parameters: The parameters required to set up a source for your pipe.
            target: The ARN of the target resource.
            target-parameters: |-
                The parameters required to set up a target for your pipe.
