            Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance.

            The location of the source EBS volume determines where you can create the snapshot.

            - If the source volume is in a Region, you must create the snapshot in the same Region as the volume.
            - If the source volume is in a Local Zone, you can create the snapshot in the same Local Zone or in its parent Amazon Web Services Region.
            - If the source volume is on an Outpost, you can create the snapshot on the same Outpost or in its parent Amazon Web Services Region.

            When a snapshot is created, any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.

            You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is `pending`.

            When you create a snapshot for an EBS volume that serves as a root device, we recommend that you stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

            Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            Describes the specified instances or all instances.

            If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

            The response includes SQL license exemption status information for instances registered with the SQL LE service, providing visibility into license exemption configuration and status.

            If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

            Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

            If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

            The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

            We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

            The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

            Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a *kernel panic* (on Linux instances), or a *blue screen*/*stop error* (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a *non-maskable interrupt* (NMI).

            In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.

            Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.

            For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see [Send a diagnostic interrupt (for advanced users)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Creates a NAT gateway in the specified subnet. This action creates a network interface in the specified subnet with a private IP address from the IP address range of the subnet. You can create either a public NAT gateway or a private NAT gateway.

            With a public NAT gateway, internet-bound traffic from a private subnet can be routed to the NAT gateway, so that instances in a private subnet can connect to the internet.

            With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs and on-premises networks through a transit gateway or virtual private gateway. Common use cases include running large workloads behind a small pool of allowlisted IPv4 addresses, preserving private IPv4 addresses, and communicating between overlapping networks.

            For more information, see [NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            When you create a public NAT gateway and assign it an EIP or secondary EIPs, the network border group of the EIPs must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the public NAT gateway is in. If it's not the same, the NAT gateway will fail to launch. You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet. Similarly, you can view the network border group of an EIP by viewing the details of the EIP address. For more information about network border groups and EIPs, see [Allocate an Elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/WorkWithEIPs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

                Specifies whether to create a zonal (single-AZ) or regional (multi-AZ) NAT gateway. Defaults to `zonal`.

                A zonal NAT gateway is a NAT Gateway that provides redundancy and scalability within a single availability zone. A regional NAT gateway is a single NAT Gateway that works across multiple availability zones (AZs) in your VPC, providing redundancy, scalability and availability across all the AZs in a Region.

                For more information, see [Regional NAT gateways for automatic multi-AZ expansion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateways-regional.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

                For regional NAT gateways only: Specifies which Availability Zones you want the NAT gateway to support and the Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) to use in each AZ. The regional NAT gateway uses these EIPs to handle outbound NAT traffic from their respective AZs. If not specified, the NAT gateway will automatically expand to new AZs and associate EIPs upon detection of an elastic network interface. If you specify this parameter, auto-expansion is disabled and you must manually manage AZ coverage.

                A regional NAT gateway is a single NAT Gateway that works across multiple availability zones (AZs) in your VPC, providing redundancy, scalability and availability across all the AZs in a Region.

            Re-enables a disabled AMI. The re-enabled AMI is marked as `available` and can be used for instance launches, appears in describe operations, and can be shared. Amazon Web Services accounts, organizations, and Organizational Units that lost access to the AMI when it was disabled do not regain access automatically. Once the AMI is available, it can be shared with them again.

            Only the AMI owner can re-enable a disabled AMI.

            By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent, to prevent undetectable, latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume.

            You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. We recommend that you change this only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable.

A VPC BPA exclusion is a mode that can be applied to a single VPC or subnet that exempts it from the account’s BPA mode and will allow bidirectional or egress-only access. You can create BPA exclusions for VPCs and subnets even when BPA is not enabled on the account to ensure that there is no traffic disruption to the exclusions when VPC BPA is turned on. To learn more about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

                Client route enforcement is a feature of the Client VPN service that helps enforce administrator defined routes on devices connected through the VPN. T his feature helps improve your security posture by ensuring that network traffic originating from a connected client is not inadvertently sent outside the VPN tunnel.

                Client route enforcement works by monitoring the route table of a connected device for routing policy changes to the VPN connection. If the feature detects any VPN routing policy modifications, it will automatically force an update to the route table, reverting it back to the expected route configurations.

            A Traffic Mirror session actively copies packets from a Traffic Mirror source to a Traffic Mirror target. Create a filter, and then assign it to the session to define a subset of the traffic to mirror, for example all TCP traffic.

            The Traffic Mirror source and the Traffic Mirror target (monitoring appliances) can be in the same VPC, or in a different VPC connected via VPC peering or a transit gateway.

            By default, no traffic is mirrored. Use [CreateTrafficMirrorFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrafficMirrorFilter.html) to create filter rules that specify the traffic to mirror.

            packet-length: |-
                The number of bytes in each packet to mirror. These are bytes after the VXLAN header. Do not specify this parameter when you want to mirror the entire packet. To mirror a subset of the packet, set this to the length (in bytes) that you want to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, then the first 100 bytes that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target.

                If you do not want to mirror the entire packet, use the `PacketLength` parameter to specify the number of bytes in each packet to mirror.

                For sessions with Network Load Balancer (NLB) Traffic Mirror targets the default `PacketLength` will be set to 8500. Valid values are 1-8500. Setting a `PacketLength` greater than 8500 will result in an error response.
            session-number: |-
                The session number determines the order in which sessions are evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions. The first session with a matching filter is the one that mirrors the packets.

            If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance.

            If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an instance that doesn't exist, or an instance that you do not own, an error (`InvalidInstanceID.NotFound`) is returned.

            Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

            In the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected Availability Zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected Availability Zone, the call works normally.

            The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

                - `instance-type` - The type of instance (for example, `t3.micro`).
                - `launch-time` - The time when the instance was launched, in the ISO 8601 format in the UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), for example, `2023-09-29T11:04:43.305Z`. You can use a wildcard (`*`), for example, `2023-09-29T*`, which matches an entire day.
                - `owner-alias` - The owner alias (`amazon` | `aws-marketplace` | `aws-backup-vault`). The valid aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained list. This is not the Amazon Web Services account alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the `Owner` request parameter instead of this filter.
                - `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the `Owner` request parameter instead of this filter.
                - `tag:<key>` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.
                - `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
                - `zone-id` - The ID of the Availability Zone (for example, `usw2-az2`) or Local Zone (for example, `usw2-lax1-az1`) of the instance.

                - `association.subnet-id` - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.
                - `association.main` - Indicates whether the route table is the main route table for the VPC (`true` | `false`). Route tables that do not have an association ID are not returned in the response.
                - `owner-id` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the route table.
                - `route-table-id` - The ID of the route table.
                - `route.destination-cidr-block` - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a route in the table.
                - `route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block` - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in a route in the route table.
                - `route.destination-prefix-list-id` - The ID (prefix) of the Amazon Web Services service specified in a route in the table.

                - `route.gateway-id` - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the table.
                - `route.instance-id` - The ID of an instance specified in a route in the table.
                - `route.nat-gateway-id` - The ID of a NAT gateway.
                - `route.transit-gateway-id` - The ID of a transit gateway.
                - `route.origin` - Describes how the route was created. `CreateRouteTable` indicates that the route was automatically created when the route table was created; `CreateRoute` indicates that the route was manually added to the route table; `EnableVgwRoutePropagation` indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.
                - `route.state` - The state of a route in the route table (`active` | `blackhole`). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so on).
                - `route.vpc-peering-connection-id` - The ID of a VPC peering connection specified in a route in the table.
                - `tag` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.
                - `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

        command: |-
            Terminates (deletes) the specified instances. This operation is [idempotent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html); if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.

            **Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

            After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered. All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost. For more information, see [How instance termination works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ec2-instance-termination-works.html).

            Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to retain after the termination to persistent storage.

            If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.

            If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request fails with the following results:

            - The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the protected instance are not terminated.
            - The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones, where no other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.

            For example, say you have the following instances:

            - Instance A: `us-east-1a`; Not protected
            - Instance B: `us-east-1a`; Not protected
            - Instance C: `us-east-1b`; Protected
            - Instance D: `us-east-1b`; not protected

            If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request reports failure with the following results:

            - Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the specified instances in `us-east-1a` are enabled for termination protection.
            - Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the specified instances in `us-east-1b` (Instance C) is enabled for termination protection.

            Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).

            By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.

            By default, the TerminateInstances operation includes a graceful operating system (OS) shutdown. To bypass the graceful shutdown, use the `skipOsShutdown` parameter; however, this might risk data integrity.

            You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the `DeleteOnTermination` block device mapping parameter set to `true` are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see [Amazon EC2 instance state changes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            When you terminate an instance, we attempt to terminate it forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the shutting-down state after a period of time, there might be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information about terminating and troubleshooting terminating your instances, see [Terminate Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) and [Troubleshooting terminating your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesShuttingDown.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Creates a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway or transit gateway and a customer gateway. The supported connection type is `ipsec.1`.

            The response includes information that you need to give to your network administrator to configure your customer gateway.

            We strongly recommend that you use HTTPS when calling this operation because the response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring your customer gateway device.

            If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and later create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure your customer gateway with the new information returned from this call.

            This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error.

            Describe verification tokens.

            A verification token is an Amazon Web Services-generated random value that you can use to prove ownership of an external resource. For example, you can use a verification token to validate that you control a public IP address range when you bring an IP address range to Amazon Web Services (BYOIP).

        command: |-
            Create an IP address pool for Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM). In IPAM, a pool is a collection of contiguous IP addresses CIDRs. Pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and security needs. For example, if you have separate routing and security needs for development and production applications, you can create a pool for each.

            For more information, see [Create a top-level pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/create-top-ipam.html) in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.
        flag:
            address-family: The IP protocol assigned to this IPAM pool. You must choose either IPv4 or IPv6 protocol for a pool.
            allocation-default-netmask-length: The default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.
            allocation-max-netmask-length: The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. The maximum netmask length must be greater than the minimum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.
            allocation-min-netmask-length: The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.
            allocation-resource-tags: Tags that are required for resources that use CIDRs from this IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be allowed to allocate space from the pool. If the resources have their tags changed after they have allocated space or if the allocation tagging requirements are changed on the pool, the resource may be marked as noncompliant.
            auto-import: |-
                If selected, IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must not already be allocated to other resources in order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

                A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.
            aws-service: Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be used in. "ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elastic IP addresses and VPCs.

                The locale for the pool should be one of the following:

                - An Amazon Web Services Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations.
                - The network border group for an Amazon Web Services Local Zone where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations ([supported Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html#byoip-zone-avail)). This option is only available for IPAM IPv4 pools in the public scope.

                Possible values: Any Amazon Web Services Region or supported Amazon Web Services Local Zone. Default is `none` and means any locale.
            public-ip-source: The IP address source for pools in the public scope. Only used for provisioning IP address CIDRs to pools in the public scope. Default is `byoip`. For more information, see [Create IPv6 pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/intro-create-ipv6-pools.html) in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*. By default, you can add only one Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block to a top-level IPv6 pool if PublicIpSource is `amazon`. For information on increasing the default limit, see [Quotas for your IPAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/quotas-ipam.html) in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.
            publicly-advertisable: Determines if the pool is publicly advertisable. The request can only contain `PubliclyAdvertisable` if `AddressFamily` is `ipv6` and `PublicIpSource` is `byoip`.
            source-ipam-pool-id: The ID of the source IPAM pool. Use this option to create a pool within an existing pool. Note that the CIDR you provision for the pool within the source pool must be available in the source pool's CIDR range.
            source-resource: The resource used to provision CIDRs to a resource planning pool.
            tag-specifications: The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

            An outbound rule permits instances to send traffic to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address ranges, the IP address ranges specified by a prefix list, or the instances that are associated with a source security group. For more information, see [Security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html).

            You must specify exactly one of the following destinations: an IPv4 or IPv6 address range, a prefix list, or a security group. You must specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). If the protocol is TCP or UDP, you must also specify a port or port range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, you must also specify the ICMP type and code.

            Rule changes are propagated to instances associated with the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

            For examples of rules that you can add to security groups for specific access scenarios, see [Security group rules for different use cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions.

            You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:

            - If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.
            - All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.
            - Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see [Instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html).
            - If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group for the VPC. For more information, see [Security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html).
            - If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.

            You can create a [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html), which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using [RunInstances](), you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.

            To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.

            `RunInstances` is subject to both request rate limiting and resource rate limiting. For more information, see [Request throttling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-throttling.html).

            An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the `running` state. You can check the state of your instance using [DescribeInstances](). You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see [CreateTags]() and [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html).

            Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see [Key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).

            For troubleshooting, see [What to do if an instance immediately terminates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.html), and [Troubleshooting connecting to your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html).
        flag:
            additional-info: Reserved.
            block-device-mappings: The block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to the instance at launch. For more information, see [Block device mappings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            capacity-reservation-specification: Information about the Capacity Reservation targeting option. If you do not specify this parameter, the instance's Capacity Reservation preference defaults to `open`, which enables it to run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone, and tenancy).
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            client-token: |-
                Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If you do not specify a client token, a randomly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency.

                For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency in Amazon EC2 API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

                Constraints: Maximum 64 ASCII characters
            cpu-options: The CPU options for the instance. For more information, see [Optimize CPU options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            credit-specification: |-
                The credit option for CPU usage of the burstable performance instance. Valid values are `standard` and `unlimited`. To change this attribute after launch, use [ModifyInstanceCreditSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceCreditSpecification.html). For more information, see [Burstable performance instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                Default: `standard` (T2 instances) or `unlimited` (T3/T3a/T4g instances)

                For T3 instances with `host` tenancy, only `standard` is supported.
            disable-api-stop: Indicates whether an instance is enabled for stop protection. For more information, see [Enable stop protection for your EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-stop-protection.html).
            disable-api-termination: Indicates whether termination protection is enabled for the instance. The default is `false`, which means that you can terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, command line tools, or API. You can enable termination protection when you launch an instance, while the instance is running, or while the instance is stopped.
            dry-run: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
            ebs-optimized: |-
                Indicates whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal Amazon EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS-optimized instance.

                Default: `false`
            elastic-gpu-specification: |-
                An elastic GPU to associate with the instance.

                Amazon Elastic Graphics reached end of life on January 8, 2024.
            elastic-inference-accelerators: |-
                An elastic inference accelerator to associate with the instance.

                Amazon Elastic Inference is no longer available.
            enable-primary-ipv6: If you’re launching an instance into a dual-stack or IPv6-only subnet, you can enable assigning a primary IPv6 address. A primary IPv6 address is an IPv6 GUA address associated with an ENI that you have enabled to use a primary IPv6 address. Use this option if an instance relies on its IPv6 address not changing. When you launch the instance, Amazon Web Services will automatically assign an IPv6 address associated with the ENI attached to your instance to be the primary IPv6 address. Once you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, you cannot disable it. When you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be made the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated or the network interface is detached. If you have multiple IPv6 addresses associated with an ENI attached to your instance and you enable a primary IPv6 address, the first IPv6 GUA address associated with the ENI becomes the primary IPv6 address.
            enclave-options: |-
                Indicates whether the instance is enabled for Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/).

                You can't enable Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves and hibernation on the same instance.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            hibernation-options: |-
                Indicates whether an instance is enabled for hibernation. This parameter is valid only if the instance meets the [hibernation prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernating-prerequisites.html). For more information, see [Hibernate your Amazon EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                You can't enable hibernation and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves on the same instance.
            iam-instance-profile: The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM instance profile.
            image-id: The ID of the AMI. An AMI ID is required to launch an instance and must be specified here or in a launch template.
            instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior: |-
                Indicates whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the operating system command for system shutdown).

                Default: `stop`
            instance-market-options: |-
                The market (purchasing) option for the instances.

                For [RunInstances](), persistent Spot Instance requests are only supported when **InstanceInterruptionBehavior** is set to either `hibernate` or `stop`.
            instance-type: The instance type. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-types.html).
            ipv6-address-count: |-
                The number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch.

                You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
            ipv6-addresses: |-
                The IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface.

                If you do not specify a key pair, you can't connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in.
            launch-template: The launch template. Any additional parameters that you specify for the new instance overwrite the corresponding parameters included in the launch template.
            license-specifications: The license configurations.
            maintenance-options: The maintenance and recovery options for the instance.
            max-count: |-
                The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify a value that is more capacity than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches the largest possible number of instances above the specified minimum count.

                Constraints: Between 1 and the quota for the specified instance type for your account for this Region. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance type quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-instance-quotas.html).
            metadata-options: The metadata options for the instance. For more information, see [Configure the Instance Metadata Service options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html).
            min-count: |-
                The minimum number of instances to launch. If you specify a value that is more capacity than Amazon EC2 can provide in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 does not launch any instances.

                Constraints: Between 1 and the quota for the specified instance type for your account for this Region. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance type quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-instance-quotas.html).

            private-ip-address: |-
                The primary IPv4 address. You must specify a value from the IPv4 address range of the subnet.

                Only one private IP address can be designated as primary. You can't specify this option if you've specified the option to designate a private IP address as the primary IP address in a network interface specification. You cannot specify this option if you're launching more than one instance in the request.

                You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
            ramdisk-id: |-
                The ID of the RAM disk to select. Some kernels require additional drivers at launch. Check the kernel requirements for information about whether you need to specify a RAM disk. To find kernel requirements, go to the Amazon Web Services Resource Center and search for the kernel ID.

                We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedkernels.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            security-group-ids: |-
                The IDs of the security groups.

                If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups as part of the network interface instead of using this parameter.
            security-groups: |-
                \[Default VPC] The names of the security groups.

                If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups as part of the network interface instead of using this parameter.

            Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes. Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.

            You can create a Capacity Reservation at any time, and you can choose when it starts. You can create a Capacity Reservation for immediate use or you can request a Capacity Reservation for a future date.

            For more information, see [Reserve compute capacity with On-Demand Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if:

            - Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity. In this case, try again at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a smaller Capacity Reservation. If your workload is flexible across instance types and sizes, try with different instance attributes.
            - The requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance quota. In this case, increase your On-Demand Instance quota for the requested instance type and try again. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            commitment-duration: |-
                Required for future-dated Capacity Reservations only. To create a Capacity Reservation for immediate use, omit this parameter.

                Specify a commitment duration, in seconds, for the future-dated Capacity Reservation.

                The commitment duration is a minimum duration for which you commit to having the future-dated Capacity Reservation in the `active` state in your account after it has been delivered.

                For more information, see [Commitment duration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/cr-concepts.html#cr-commitment-duration).
            delivery-preference: |-
                Required for future-dated Capacity Reservations only. To create a Capacity Reservation for immediate use, omit this parameter.

                Indicates that the requested capacity will be delivered in addition to any running instances or reserved capacity that you have in your account at the requested date and time.

                The only supported value is `incremental`.
            dry-run: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
            ebs-optimized: Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.
            end-date: |-
                The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to `expired` when it reaches its end date and time.

                You must provide an `EndDate` value if `EndDateType` is `limited`. Omit `EndDate` if `EndDateType` is `unlimited`.

                If the `EndDateType` is `limited`, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

                If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you can't specify an end date and time that is within the commitment duration.
            end-date-type: |-
                Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

                - `unlimited` - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an `EndDate` if the `EndDateType` is `unlimited`.
                - `limited` - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an `EndDate` value if the `EndDateType` value is `limited`.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            instance-count: |-
                The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.

                You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for an instance count with a minimum of 32 vCPUs. For example, if you request a future-dated Capacity Reservation for `m5.xlarge` instances, you must request at least 8 instances (*8 * m5.xlarge = 32 vCPUs*).

                Valid range: 1 - 1000
            instance-match-criteria: |-
                Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:

                - `open` - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
                - `targeted` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.

                If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you must specify `targeted`.

                Default: `open`
            instance-platform: The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.
            instance-type: |-
                The instance type for which to reserve capacity.

                You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for instance types in the C, M, R, I, T, and G instance families only.

            Describes an Elastic IP address transfer. For more information, see [Transfer Elastic IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html#transfer-EIPs-intro) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake between the source and transfer Amazon Web Services accounts. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer account has seven days to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the source account can view the pending transfer by using this action. After seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of the Elastic IP address returns to the source account. Accepted transfers are visible to the source account for 14 days after the transfers have been accepted.

            Removes the specified outbound (egress) rules from the specified security group.

            You can specify rules using either rule IDs or security group rule properties. If you use rule properties, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly. Each rule has a protocol, from and to ports, and destination (CIDR range, security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not need to specify the description to revoke the rule.

            For a default VPC, if the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the security group rules that were not revoked.

            Amazon Web Services recommends that you describe the security group to verify that the rules were removed.

            Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

            Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.

            You must specify either a destination CIDR block or a prefix list ID. You must also specify exactly one of the resources from the parameter list.

            When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address `192.0.2.3`, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:

            - `192.0.2.0/24` (goes to some target A)
            - `192.0.2.0/28` (goes to some target B)

            Both routes apply to the traffic destined for `192.0.2.3`. However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the ACL, we process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of ingress rules and a separate set of egress rules.

            We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example, 100, 110, 120, ...), and not number them one right after the other (for example, 101, 102, 103, ...). This makes it easier to add a rule between existing ones without having to renumber the rules.

            After you add an entry, you can't modify it; you must either replace it, or create an entry and delete the old one.

                An identifier for the symmetric KMS key to use when creating the encrypted snapshot. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default KMS key; if this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for EBS is used. If a `KmsKeyId` is specified, the `Encrypted` flag must also be set.

                The KMS key identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:

                - Key ID
                - Key alias
                - ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `key` namespace, and then the key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:key/*abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef*.
                - ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `alias` namespace, and then the key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:alias/*ExampleAlias*.

                Amazon Web Services parses `KmsKeyId` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.

                The specified KMS key must exist in the Region that the snapshot is being copied to.

            Creates a subnet in the specified VPC. For an IPv4 only subnet, specify an IPv4 CIDR block. If the VPC has an IPv6 CIDR block, you can create an IPv6 only subnet or a dual stack subnet instead. For an IPv6 only subnet, specify an IPv6 CIDR block. For a dual stack subnet, specify both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block.

            A subnet CIDR block must not overlap the CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block.

            The allowed size for an IPv4 subnet is between a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses) and a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses). Amazon Web Services reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for your use.

            If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with a subnet when you create it.

            If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.

            When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.

            You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume size, volume type, and IOPS capacity. If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you might be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-modify-volume.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For more information, see [Extend the file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html).

            For more information, see [Monitor the progress of volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance.

            After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours and ensure that the volume is in the `in-use` or `available` state before you can modify the same volume. This is sometimes referred to as a cooldown period.

            Enables EBS encryption by default for your account in the current Region.

            After you enable encryption by default, the EBS volumes that you create are always encrypted, either using the default KMS key or the KMS key that you specified when you created each volume. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            Enabling encryption by default has no effect on the encryption status of your existing volumes.

            After you enable encryption by default, you can no longer launch instances using instance types that do not support encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption-requirements.html#ebs-encryption_supported_instances).

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            Gets the routing database for the specified route server. The [Routing Information Base (RIB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table) serves as a database that stores all the routing information and network topology data collected by a router or routing system, such as routes learned from BGP peers. The RIB is constantly updated as new routing information is received or existing routes change. This ensures that the route server always has the most current view of the network topology and can make optimal routing decisions.

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            While the EC2 Fleet is being modified, it is in the `modifying` state.

            To scale up your EC2 Fleet, increase its target capacity. The EC2 Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the EC2 Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is `lowest-price`, the EC2 Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the EC2 Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is `capacity-optimized`, EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

            To scale down your EC2 Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the EC2 Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the EC2 Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is `lowest-price`, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is `capacity-optimized`, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the EC2 Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the EC2 Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

            If you are finished with your EC2 Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

            Deletes the specified VPN connection.

            If you're deleting the VPC and its associated components, we recommend that you detach the virtual private gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting the VPN connection. If you believe that the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have been compromised, you can delete the VPN connection and create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the VPC or virtual private gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure the customer gateway device using the new configuration information returned with the new VPN connection ID.

            For certificate-based authentication, delete all Certificate Manager (ACM) private certificates used for the Amazon Web Services-side tunnel endpoints for the VPN connection before deleting the VPN connection.

            Each version is a snapshot of what CIDRs matched your rules at that moment in time. The version number increments every time the CIDR list changes due to infrastructure changes.

            **Version example:**

            **Initial State (Version 1)**

            Production environment:

            - vpc-prod-web (10.1.0.0/16) - tagged env=prod
            - vpc-prod-db (10.2.0.0/16) - tagged env=prod

            Resolver rule: Include all VPCs tagged env=prod

            **Version 1 CIDRs:** 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16

            **Infrastructure Change (Version 2)**

            New VPC added:

            - vpc-prod-api (10.3.0.0/16) - tagged env=prod

            IPAM automatically detects the change and creates a new version.

        command: |-
            Creates a Spot Fleet request.

            The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity.

            You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.

            By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload.

            Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet.

            You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the `spot-fleet-request` and `instance` resource types are supported.

            For more information, see [Spot Fleet requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            We strongly discourage using the RequestSpotFleet API because it is a legacy API with no planned investment. For options for requesting Spot Instances, see [Which is the best Spot request method to use?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#which-spot-request-method-to-use) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        command: |-
            Initiates an AMI copy operation. You must specify the source AMI ID and both the source and destination locations. The copy operation must be initiated in the destination Region.

            **CopyImage supports the following source to destination copies:**

            - Region to Region
            - Region to Outpost
            - Parent Region to Local Zone
            - Local Zone to parent Region
            - Between Local Zones with the same parent Region (only supported for certain Local Zones)

            **CopyImage does not support the following source to destination copies:**

            - Local Zone to non-parent Regions
            - Between Local Zones with different parent Regions
            - Local Zone to Outpost
            - Outpost to Local Zone
            - Outpost to Region
            - Between Outposts
            - Within same Outpost
            - Cross-partition copies (use [CreateStoreImageTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStoreImageTask.html) instead)

            **Destination specification**

            - Region to Region: The destination Region is the Region in which you initiate the copy operation.
            - Region to Outpost: Specify the destination using the `DestinationOutpostArn` parameter (the ARN of the Outpost)
            - Region to Local Zone, and Local Zone to Local Zone copies: Specify the destination using the `DestinationAvailabilityZone` parameter (the name of the destination Local Zone) or `DestinationAvailabilityZoneId` parameter (the ID of the destination Local Zone).

            **Snapshot encryption**

            - Region to Outpost: Backing snapshots copied to an Outpost are encrypted by default using the default encryption key for the Region or the key that you specify. Outposts do not support unencrypted snapshots.
            - Region to Local Zone, and Local Zone to Local Zone: Not all Local Zones require encrypted snapshots. In Local Zones that require encrypted snapshots, backing snapshots are automatically encrypted during copy. In Local Zones where encryption is not required, snapshots retain their original encryption state (encrypted or unencrypted) by default.

            For more information, including the required permissions for copying an AMI, see [Copy an Amazon EC2 AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            destination-outpost-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost for the new AMI.

                Only specify this parameter when copying an AMI from an Amazon Web Services Region to an Outpost. The AMI must be in the Region of the destination Outpost. You can't copy an AMI from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost.

                For more information, see [Copy AMIs from an Amazon Web Services Region to an Outpost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshots-outposts.html#copy-amis) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            encrypted: |-
                Specifies whether to encrypt the snapshots of the copied image.

                You can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, but you cannot create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted snapshot. The default KMS key for Amazon EBS is used unless you specify a non-default Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key using `KmsKeyId`. For more information, see [Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            kms-key-id: |-
                The identifier of the symmetric Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use when creating encrypted volumes. If this parameter is not specified, your Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If you specify a KMS key, you must also set the encrypted state to `true`.

                You can specify a KMS key using any of the following:

                - Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
                - Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
                - Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
                - Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

                Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an identifier that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

                The specified KMS key must exist in the destination Region.

                Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.
            name: The name of the new AMI.
            snapshot-copy-completion-duration-minutes: |-
                Specify a completion duration, in 15 minute increments, to initiate a time-based AMI copy. The specified completion duration applies to each of the snapshots associated with the AMI. Each snapshot associated with the AMI will be completed within the specified completion duration, with copy throughput automatically adjusted for each snapshot based on its size to meet the timing target.

                If you do not specify a value, the AMI copy operation is completed on a best-effort basis.

                This parameter is not supported when copying an AMI to or from a Local Zone, or to an Outpost.

                For more information, see [Time-based copies for Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/time-based-copies.html).
            source-image-id: The ID of the AMI to copy.
            source-region: The name of the Region that contains the AMI to copy.
            tag-specifications: |-
                The tags to apply to the new AMI and new snapshots. You can tag the AMI, the snapshots, or both.

                - To tag the new AMI, the value for `ResourceType` must be `image`.
                - To tag the new snapshots, the value for `ResourceType` must be `snapshot`. The same tag is applied to all the new snapshots.

                If you specify other values for `ResourceType`, the request fails.

            Describes a tree-based hierarchy that represents the physical host placement of your pending or active Capacity Reservations within an Availability Zone or Local Zone. You can use this information to determine the relative proximity of your capacity within the Amazon Web Services network before it is launched and use this information to allocate capacity together to support your tightly coupled workloads.

            Capacity Reservation topology is supported for specific instance types only. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Amazon EC2 instance topology](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-topology-prerequisites.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model due to the distributed nature of the system supporting it. As a result, when you call the DescribeCapacityReservationTopology API command immediately after launching instances, the response might return a `null` value for `capacityBlockId` because the data might not have fully propagated across all subsystems. For more information, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

            Retrieves the encrypted administrator password for a running Windows instance.

            The Windows password is generated at boot by the `EC2Config` service or `EC2Launch` scripts (Windows Server 2016 and later). This usually only happens the first time an instance is launched. For more information, see [EC2Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html) and [EC2Launch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2launch.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            For the `EC2Config` service, the password is not generated for rebundled AMIs unless `Ec2SetPassword` is enabled before bundling.

            The password is encrypted using the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance. You must provide the corresponding key pair file.

            When you launch an instance, password generation and encryption may take a few minutes. If you try to retrieve the password before it's available, the output returns an empty string. We recommend that you wait up to 15 minutes after launching an instance before trying to retrieve the generated password.

No restrictions are placed on AMI discoverability or usage. Users in your account can launch instances using any public AMI or AMI shared with your account.\n  \n  The purpose of `audit-mode` is to indicate which AMIs will be affected when Allowed AMIs is `enabled`. In `audit-mode`, each AMI displays either `\"ImageAllowed\": true` or `\"ImageAllowed\": false` to indicate whether the AMI will be discoverable and available to users in the account when Allowed AMIs is enabled.\n\nThe Allowed AMIs feature does not restrict the AMIs owned by your account. Regardless of the criteria you set, the AMIs created by your account will always be discoverable and usable by users in your account.\n\nFor more information, see [Control the discovery and use of AMIs in Amazon EC2 with Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html) in *Amazon EC2 User Guide*."

            Creates a listing for Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances to be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. You can submit one Standard Reserved Instance listing at a time. To get a list of your Standard Reserved Instances, you can use the [DescribeReservedInstances]() operation.

            Only Standard Reserved Instances can be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. Convertible Reserved Instances cannot be sold.

            The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Standard Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances.

            To sell your Standard Reserved Instances, you must first register as a seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. After completing the registration process, you can create a Reserved Instance Marketplace listing of some or all of your Standard Reserved Instances, and specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Standard Reserved Instance listings then become available for purchase. To view the details of your Standard Reserved Instance listing, you can use the [DescribeReservedInstancesListings]() operation.

            By default, you can associate up to 2 Elastic IP addresses per public NAT gateway. You can increase the limit by requesting a quota adjustment. For more information, see [Elastic IP address quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-limits-eips) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            When you associate an EIP or secondary EIPs with a public NAT gateway, the network border group of the EIPs must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the public NAT gateway is in. If it's not the same, the EIP will fail to associate. You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet. Similarly, you can view the network border group of an EIP by viewing the details of the EIP address.

            Modifies the ID format for the specified resource on a per-Region basis. You can specify that resources should receive longer IDs (17-character IDs) when they are created.

            This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource types that are within the opt-in period. Resources currently in their opt-in period include: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway`.

            This setting applies to the IAM user who makes the request; it does not apply to the entire Amazon Web Services account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user. If you're using this action as the root user, then these settings apply to the entire account, unless an IAM user explicitly overrides these settings for themselves. For more information, see [Resource IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resource-ids.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

            Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM roles and users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant `Describe` command for the resource type.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

For more information, see [Configure SIP for Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/mac-sip-settings.html#mac-sip-configure) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            When you configure the SIP settings for your instance, you can either enable or disable all SIP settings, or you can specify a custom SIP configuration that selectively enables or disables specific SIP settings.

            If you implement a custom configuration, [connect to the instance and verify the settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/mac-sip-settings.html#mac-sip-check-settings) to ensure that your requirements are properly implemented and functioning as intended.

            SIP configurations might change with macOS updates. We recommend that you review custom SIP settings after any macOS version upgrade to ensure continued compatibility and proper functionality of your security configurations.

            To enable or disable all SIP settings, use the **MacSystemIntegrityProtectionStatus** parameter only. For example, to enable all SIP settings, specify the following:

            - `MacSystemIntegrityProtectionStatus=enabled`

            To specify a custom configuration that selectively enables or disables specific SIP settings, use the **MacSystemIntegrityProtectionStatus** parameter to enable or disable all SIP settings, and then use the **MacSystemIntegrityProtectionConfiguration** parameter to specify exceptions. In this case, the exceptions you specify for **MacSystemIntegrityProtectionConfiguration** override the value you specify for **MacSystemIntegrityProtectionStatus**. For example, to enable all SIP settings, except `NvramProtections`, specify the following:

            - `MacSystemIntegrityProtectionStatus=enabled`
            - `MacSystemIntegrityProtectionConfigurationRequest "NvramProtections=disabled"`

        command: |-
            Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet request.

            After you delete an EC2 Fleet request, it launches no new instances.

            You must also specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet request should terminate its instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet request enters the `deleted_terminating` state. Otherwise, it enters the `deleted_running` state, and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

            A deleted `instant` fleet with running instances is not supported. When you delete an `instant` fleet, Amazon EC2 automatically terminates all its instances. For fleets with more than 1000 instances, the deletion request might fail. If your fleet has more than 1000 instances, first terminate most of the instances manually, leaving 1000 or fewer. Then delete the fleet, and the remaining instances will be terminated automatically.

            **Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

            After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered. All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost. For more information, see [How instance termination works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ec2-instance-termination-works.html).

            Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to retain after the termination to persistent storage.

            **Restrictions**

            - You can delete up to 25 fleets of type `instant` in a single request.
            - You can delete up to 100 fleets of type `maintain` or `request` in a single request.
            - You can delete up to 125 fleets in a single request, provided you do not exceed the quota for each fleet type, as specified above.
            - If you exceed the specified number of fleets to delete, no fleets are deleted.

            For more information, see [Delete an EC2 Fleet request and the instances in the fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/delete-fleet.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                An identifier for the symmetric KMS key to use when creating the encrypted AMI. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default KMS key; if this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for EBS is used. If a `KmsKeyId` is specified, the `Encrypted` flag must also be set.

                The KMS key identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:

                - Key ID
                - Key alias
                - ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `key` namespace, and then the key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:key/*abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef*.
                - ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `alias` namespace, and then the key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:alias/*ExampleAlias*.

                Amazon Web Services parses `KmsKeyId` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.

                The specified KMS key must exist in the Region that the AMI is being copied to.

                Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.
            license-specifications: The ARNs of the license configurations.
            license-type: |-
                The license type to be used for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) after importing.

                Specify `AWS` to replace the source-system license with an Amazon Web Services license or `BYOL` to retain the source-system license. Leaving this parameter undefined is the same as choosing `AWS` when importing a Windows Server operating system, and the same as choosing `BYOL` when importing a Windows client operating system (such as Windows 10) or a Linux operating system.

                To use `BYOL`, you must have existing licenses with rights to use these licenses in a third party cloud, such as Amazon Web Services. For more information, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html#prerequisites-image) in the VM Import/Export User Guide.
            platform: |-
                The operating system of the virtual machine. If you import a VM that is compatible with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) using an EBS snapshot, you must specify a value for the platform.

                Indicates whether IMDSv2 is required.

                - `optional` - IMDSv2 is optional. You can choose whether to send a session token in your instance metadata retrieval requests. If you retrieve IAM role credentials without a session token, you receive the IMDSv1 role credentials. If you retrieve IAM role credentials using a valid session token, you receive the IMDSv2 role credentials.
                - `required` - IMDSv2 is required. You must send a session token in your instance metadata retrieval requests. With this option, retrieving the IAM role credentials always returns IMDSv2 credentials; IMDSv1 credentials are not available.

                Default:

                - If the value of `ImdsSupport` for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for your instance is `v2.0` and the account level default is set to `no-preference`, the default is `required`.

            Modifies the allocation rules in an IPAM policy.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            Allocation rules are optional configurations within an IPAM policy that map Amazon Web Services resource types to specific IPAM pools. If no rules are defined, the resource types default to using Amazon-provided IP addresses.

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account.

            Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short interval and then return empty results. After all instances that reference a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the image will eventually return an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be found.

            When Allowed AMIs is set to `enabled`, only allowed images are returned in the results, with the `imageAllowed` field set to `true` for each image. In `audit-mode`, the `imageAllowed` field is set to `true` for images that meet the account's Allowed AMIs criteria, and `false` for images that don't meet the criteria. For more information, see [Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html).

            The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

            We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

            The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

            Gets information about the route propagations for the specified route server.

            When enabled, route server propagation installs the routes in the FIB on the route table you've specified. Route server supports IPv4 and IPv6 route propagation.

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            Disables route propagation from a route server to a specified route table.

            When enabled, route server propagation installs the routes in the FIB on the route table you've specified. Route server supports IPv4 and IPv6 route propagation.

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            Deletes an IPAM policy.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable performance instances. The credit options are `standard` and `unlimited`.

            If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable performance instances with the `unlimited` credit option, as well as instances that were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the `unlimited` credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as `unlimited`, to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance.

            If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option (`standard` or `unlimited`) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a burstable performance instance, an error is returned.

            Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

            If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

            Describes the ID format settings for your resources on a per-Region basis, for example, to view which resource types are enabled for longer IDs. This request only returns information about resource types whose ID formats can be modified; it does not return information about other resource types.

            The following resource types support longer IDs: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `instance` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `reservation` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `snapshot` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `volume` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway`.

            These settings apply to the IAM user who makes the request; they do not apply to the entire Amazon Web Services account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user, unless they explicitly override the settings by running the [ModifyIdFormat]() command. Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant `Describe` command for the resource type.

            Generates an account status report. The report is generated asynchronously, and can take several hours to complete.

            The report provides the current status of all attributes supported by declarative policies for the accounts within the specified scope. The scope is determined by the specified `TargetId`, which can represent an individual account, or all the accounts that fall under the specified organizational unit (OU) or root (the entire Amazon Web Services Organization).

            The report is saved to your specified S3 bucket, using the following path structure (with the capitalized placeholders representing your specific values):

            `s3://AMZN-S3-DEMO-BUCKET/YOUR-OPTIONAL-S3-PREFIX/ec2_TARGETID_REPORTID_YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ.csv`

            **Prerequisites for generating a report**

            - The `StartDeclarativePoliciesReport` API can only be called by the management account or delegated administrators for the organization.
            - An S3 bucket must be available before generating the report (you can create a new one or use an existing one), it must be in the same Region where the report generation request is made, and it must have an appropriate bucket policy. For a sample S3 policy, see *Sample Amazon S3 policy* under [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport.html#API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport_Examples).
            - Trusted access must be enabled for the service for which the declarative policy will enforce a baseline configuration. If you use the Amazon Web Services Organizations console, this is done automatically when you enable declarative policies. The API uses the following service principal to identify the EC2 service: `ec2.amazonaws.com`. For more information on how to enable trusted access with the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Services SDKs, see [Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide*.
            - Only one report per organization can be generated at a time. Attempting to generate a report while another is in progress will result in an error.

            For more information, including the required IAM permissions to run this API, see [Generating the account status report for declarative policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_status-report.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide*.

The number of secondary IP addresses that you can assign to an instance varies by instance type. For more information about Elastic IP addresses, see [Elastic IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Remapping an IP address is an asynchronous operation. When you move an IP address from one network interface to another, check `network/interfaces/macs/mac/local-ipv4s` in the instance metadata to confirm that the remapping is complete.

            You must specify either the IP addresses or the IP address count in the request.

            You can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You must specify either the IPv4 Prefix Delegation prefixes, or the IPv4 Prefix Delegation count.

            Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you.

            The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions.

            The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

            - *public*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the `all` group. All Amazon Web Services accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.
            - *explicit*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.
            - *implicit*: An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.

            The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

            If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.

            If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the `OwnerIds` option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, `amazon` for snapshots owned by Amazon, or `self` for snapshots that you own.

            If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), `self` for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or `all` for public snapshots.

            If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).

            For more information about EBS snapshots, see [Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

                - `encrypted` - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted (`true` | `false`)
                - `owner-alias` - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (`amazon`). This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
                - `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
                - `progress` - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).
                - `snapshot-id` - The snapshot ID.
                - `start-time` - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.
                - `status` - The status of the snapshot (`pending` | `completed` | `error`).
                - `storage-tier` - The storage tier of the snapshot (`archive` | `standard`).
                - `transfer-type` - The type of operation used to create the snapshot (`time-based` | `standard`).
                - `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.
                - `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
                - `volume-id` - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.
                - `volume-size` - The size of the volume, in GiB.

                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).
            next-token: The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

The default credit option is set at the account level per Amazon Web Services Region, and is specified per instance family. All new burstable performance instances in the account launch using the default credit option.

            `ModifyDefaultCreditSpecification` is an asynchronous operation, which works at an Amazon Web Services Region level and modifies the credit option for each Availability Zone. All zones in a Region are updated within five minutes. But if instances are launched during this operation, they might not get the new credit option until the zone is updated. To verify whether the update has occurred, you can call `GetDefaultCreditSpecification` and check `DefaultCreditSpecification` for updates.

            The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances.

            As a seller, you choose to list some or all of your Reserved Instances, and you specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved Instances are then listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace and are available for purchase.

            As a buyer, you specify the configuration of the Reserved Instance to purchase, and the Marketplace matches what you're searching for with what's available. The Marketplace first sells the lowest priced Reserved Instances to you, and continues to sell available Reserved Instance listings to you until your demand is met. You are charged based on the total price of all of the listings that you purchase.

            For more information, see [Sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:\n  \n  - `default` - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.\n  - `dedicated` - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services account.\n- `outpost-arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which the Capacity Reservation was created.\n- `state` - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can be in one of the following states:\n  \n  - `active`- The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is available for your use.\n  - `expired` - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the date and time specified in your request. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.\n  - `cancelled` - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.\n  - `pending` - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still pending.\n  - `failed` - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.\n- `start-date` - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.\n- `end-date` - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.\n- `end-date-type` - Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:\n  \n  - `unlimited` - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it.\n  - `limited` - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time.\n- `instance-match-criteria` - Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:\n  \n  - `open` - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.\n  - `targeted` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.\n- `placement-group-arn` - The ARN of the cluster placement group in which the Capacity Reservation was created."

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            Adds the specified inbound (ingress) rules to a security group.

            An inbound rule permits instances to receive traffic from the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address range, the IP address ranges that are specified by a prefix list, or the instances that are associated with a destination security group. For more information, see [Security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html).

            You must specify exactly one of the following sources: an IPv4 or IPv6 address range, a prefix list, or a security group. You must specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). If the protocol is TCP or UDP, you must also specify a port or port range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, you must also specify the ICMP/ICMPv6 type and code.

            Rule changes are propagated to instances associated with the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

            For examples of rules that you can add to security groups for specific access scenarios, see [Security group rules for different use cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR block, Amazon Web Services canonicalizes the CIDR block to 100.68.0.0/18. Any subsequent DescribeSecurityGroups and DescribeSecurityGroupRules calls will return the canonicalized form of the CIDR block. Additionally, if you attempt to add another rule with the non-canonical form of the CIDR (such as 100.68.0.18/18) and there is already a rule for the canonicalized form of the CIDR block (such as 100.68.0.0/18), the API throws an duplicate rule error.

            Cancels the specified Spot Fleet requests.

            After you cancel a Spot Fleet request, the Spot Fleet launches no new instances.

            You must also specify whether a canceled Spot Fleet request should terminate its instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the Spot Fleet request enters the `cancelled_terminating` state. Otherwise, the Spot Fleet request enters the `cancelled_running` state and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

            **Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

            After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered. All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost. For more information, see [How instance termination works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ec2-instance-termination-works.html).

            Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to retain after the termination to persistent storage.

            **Restrictions**

            - You can delete up to 100 fleets in a single request. If you exceed the specified number, no fleets are deleted.

            Describes a tree-based hierarchy that represents the physical host placement of your EC2 instances within an Availability Zone or Local Zone. You can use this information to determine the relative proximity of your EC2 instances within the Amazon Web Services network to support your tightly coupled workloads.

            Instance topology is supported for specific instance types only. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Amazon EC2 instance topology](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-topology-prerequisites.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model due to the distributed nature of the system supporting it. As a result, when you call the DescribeInstanceTopology API command immediately after launching instances, the response might return a `null` value for `capacityBlockId` because the data might not have fully propagated across all subsystems. For more information, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

                The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).

                You can't specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same request.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* and [Security groups for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            When you create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your choice. You can't have two security groups for the same VPC with the same name.

            You have a default security group for use in your VPC. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each other.

            You can add or remove rules from your security groups using [AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress](), [AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress](), [RevokeSecurityGroupIngress](), and [RevokeSecurityGroupEgress]().

            Limitations and rules apply to a VPC peering connection. For more information, see the [VPC peering limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-basics.html#vpc-peering-limitations) in the *VPC Peering Guide*.

            The owner of the accepter VPC must accept the peering request to activate the peering connection. The VPC peering connection request expires after 7 days, after which it cannot be accepted or rejected.

            If you create a VPC peering connection request between VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks, the VPC peering connection has a status of `failed`.

For more information, see [Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide*.

            When the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key are placed in an Amazon S3 location that only the associated IAM role can access. The private key of the certificate is encrypted with an Amazon Web Services managed key that has an attached attestation-based key policy.

            To enable the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant it permission to call `s3:GetObject` on the Amazon S3 bucket returned by the command. To enable the IAM role to access the KMS key, you must grant it permission to call `kms:Decrypt` on the KMS key returned by the command.

            A binary representation of the UEFI variable store. Only non-volatile variables are stored. This is a base64 encoded and zlib compressed binary value that must be properly encoded.

            When you use [register-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.html) to create an AMI, you can create an exact copy of your variable store by passing the UEFI data in the `UefiData` parameter. You can modify the UEFI data by using the [python-uefivars tool](https://github.com/awslabs/python-uefivars) on GitHub. You can use the tool to convert the UEFI data into a human-readable format (JSON), which you can inspect and modify, and then convert back into the binary format to use with register-image.

            For more information, see [UEFI Secure Boot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/uefi-secure-boot.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

To create the optimized Windows image, Amazon EC2 launches an instance and runs through Sysprep steps, rebooting as required. Then it creates a set of reserved snapshots that are used for subsequent launches. The reserved snapshots are automatically replenished as they are used, depending on your settings for launch frequency.

            Creates an IPAM policy.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            For more information, see [Define public IPv4 allocation strategy with IPAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/define-public-ipv4-allocation-strategy-with-ipam-policies.html) in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

        command: |-
            Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.

            The `DescribeVolumeStatus` operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:

            *Status*: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are `ok`, `impaired` , `warning`, or `insufficient-data`. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is `ok`. If the check fails, the overall status is `impaired`. If the status is `insufficient-data`, then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see [Monitor the status of your volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/monitoring-volume-status.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            *Events*: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an `impaired` status, then the volume event might be `potential-data-inconsistency`. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.

            *Actions*: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is `impaired` and the volume event shows `potential-data-inconsistency`, then the action shows `enable-volume-io`. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume and then check the volume for data consistency. For more information, see [Work with an impaired EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/work_volumes_impaired.html).

            Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the `error` state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

            The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

            Deregistering an AMI does not delete the following:

            - Instances already launched from the AMI. You'll continue to incur usage costs for the instances until you terminate them.
            - For EBS-backed AMIs: Snapshots that are associated with multiple AMIs. You'll continue to incur snapshot storage costs.

            Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.

            Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.

            Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

            Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error.

            If you attempt to start a T3 instance with `host` tenancy and the `unlimited` CPU credit option, the request fails. The `unlimited` CPU credit option is not supported on Dedicated Hosts. Before you start the instance, either change its CPU credit option to `standard`, or change its tenancy to `default` or `dedicated`.

            Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

            You can use `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` to find a running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is `fulfilled`, the instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance. Alternatively, you can use [DescribeInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances) with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is `spot`.

            We recommend that you set `MaxResults` to a value between 5 and 1000 to limit the number of items returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list more manageable and returns the items faster. If the list of items exceeds your `MaxResults` value, then that number of items is returned along with a `NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` request to retrieve the remaining items.

            Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.

            Removes the specified inbound (ingress) rules from a security group.

            You can specify rules using either rule IDs or security group rule properties. If you use rule properties, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly. Each rule has a protocol, from and to ports, and source (CIDR range, security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not need to specify the description to revoke the rule.

            For a default VPC, if the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the security group rules that were not revoked.

            For a non-default VPC, if the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, an `InvalidPermission.NotFound` client error is returned, and no rules are revoked.

            Amazon Web Services recommends that you describe the security group to verify that the rules were removed.

            Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

            Describes the progress of the AMI store tasks. You can describe the store tasks for specified AMIs. If you don't specify the AMIs, you get a paginated list of store tasks from the last 31 days.

            For each AMI task, the response indicates if the task is `InProgress`, `Completed`, or `Failed`. For tasks `InProgress`, the response shows the estimated progress as a percentage.

            Tasks are listed in reverse chronological order. Currently, only tasks from the past 31 days can be viewed.

            To use this API, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see [Permissions for storing and restoring AMIs using S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/work-with-ami-store-restore.html#ami-s3-permissions) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Creates a transit gateway.

            You can use a transit gateway to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks. After the transit gateway enters the `available` state, you can attach your VPCs and VPN connections to the transit gateway.

            To attach your VPCs, use [CreateTransitGatewayVpcAttachment]().

            To attach a VPN connection, use [CreateCustomerGateway]() to create a customer gateway and specify the ID of the customer gateway and the ID of the transit gateway in a call to [CreateVpnConnection]().

            When you create a transit gateway, we create a default transit gateway route table and use it as the default association route table and the default propagation route table. You can use [CreateTransitGatewayRouteTable]() to create additional transit gateway route tables. If you disable automatic route propagation, we do not create a default transit gateway route table. You can use [EnableTransitGatewayRouteTablePropagation]() to propagate routes from a resource attachment to a transit gateway route table. If you disable automatic associations, you can use [AssociateTransitGatewayRouteTable]() to associate a resource attachment with a transit gateway route table.

            disable-lni-at-device-index: Specify `true` to indicate that local network interfaces at the current position should be disabled.
            enable-dns64: |-
                Indicates whether DNS queries made to the Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet should return synthetic IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations.

                You must first configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet (separate from the subnet containing the IPv6-only workloads). For example, the subnet containing the NAT gateway should have a `0.0.0.0/0` route pointing to the internet gateway. For more information, see [Configure DNS64 and NAT64](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-nat64-dns64.html#nat-gateway-nat64-dns64-walkthrough) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
            enable-lni-at-device-index: Indicates the device position for local network interfaces in this subnet. For example, `1` indicates local network interfaces in this subnet are the secondary network interface (eth1). A local network interface cannot be the primary network interface (eth0).
            enable-resource-name-dns-a-record-on-launch: Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records.
            enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch: Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records.

            max-results: The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. This value can be between 5 and 1000. If this parameter is not specified, then all items are returned. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).
            next-token: The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Describes one or more route server endpoints.

            A route server endpoint is an Amazon Web Services-managed component inside a subnet that facilitates [BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) connections between your route server and your BGP peers.

            For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            Registers an AMI. When you're creating an instance-store backed AMI, registering the AMI is the final step in the creation process. For more information about creating AMIs, see [Create an AMI from a snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot) and [Create an instance-store backed AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.

            **Register a snapshot of a root device volume**

            You can use `RegisterImage` to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted.

            For more information, see [Create an AMI from a snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot) and [Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            **Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes**

            If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI.

            In most cases, AMIs for Windows, RedHat, SUSE, and SQL Server require correct licensing information to be present on the AMI. For more information, see [Understand AMI billing information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*. When creating an AMI from a snapshot, the `RegisterImage` operation derives the correct billing information from the snapshot's metadata, but this requires the appropriate metadata to be present. To verify if the correct billing information was applied, check the `PlatformDetails` field on the new AMI. If the field is empty or doesn't match the expected operating system code (for example, Windows, RedHat, SUSE, or SQL), the AMI creation was unsuccessful, and you should discard the AMI and instead create the AMI from an instance. For more information, see [Create an AMI from an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#how-to-create-ebs-ami) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance is not applied to the On-Demand Instance. For information about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see [Understand AMI billing information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

You must first register as a seller on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. For more information, see [Getting started as an Amazon Web Services Marketplace seller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/user-guide-for-sellers.html) and [AMI-based products in Amazon Web Services Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/ami-products.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Marketplace Seller Guide*.

                If you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must be on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on an Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances on the same Outpost only.

            You can't modify or cancel a Capacity Block. For more information, see [Capacity Blocks for ML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-blocks.html).

            If a future-dated Capacity Reservation enters the `delayed` state, the commitment duration is waived, and you can cancel it as soon as it enters the `active` state.

            Instances running in the reserved capacity continue running until you stop them. Stopped instances that target the Capacity Reservation can no longer launch. Modify these instances to either target a different Capacity Reservation, launch On-Demand Instance capacity, or run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and sufficient capacity.

            Creates an Amazon EBS-backed AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance that is either running or stopped.

            If you customized your instance with instance store volumes or Amazon EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the new AMI contains block device mapping information for those volumes. When you launch an instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with those additional volumes.

            The location of the source instance determines where you can create the snapshots of the AMI:

            - If the source instance is in a Region, you must create the snapshots in the same Region as the instance.
            - If the source instance is in a Local Zone, you can create the snapshots in the same Local Zone or in its parent Region.

            For more information, see [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

To create an AMI with volumes or snapshots that have a different encryption status (for example, where the source volume and snapshots are unencrypted, and you want to create an AMI with encrypted volumes or snapshots), copy the image instead.

                - To tag the snapshots that are created of the root volume and of other Amazon EBS volumes that are attached to the instance, the value for `ResourceType` must be `snapshot`. The same tag is applied to all of the snapshots that are created.

                If you specify other values for `ResourceType`, the request fails.

                To tag an AMI or snapshot after it has been created, see [CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html).

After you associate a DHCP option set with a VPC, all existing and newly launched instances in the VPC use this set of DHCP options.\n\nThe following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information, see [DHCP option sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.\n\n- `domain-name` - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in `us-east-1`, specify `ec2.internal`. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in any other Region, specify `region.compute.internal`. Otherwise, specify a custom domain name. This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames.\n  \n  Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP option set is associated with a VPC that has instances running operating systems that treat the value as a single domain, specify only one domain name.\n- `domain-name-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four DNS servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. To specify multiple domain name servers in a single parameter, separate the IP addresses using commas. To have your instances receive custom DNS hostnames as specified in `domain-name`, you must specify a custom DNS server.\n- `ntp-servers` - The IP addresses of up to eight Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers (four IPv4 addresses and four IPv6 addresses).\n- `netbios-name-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.\n- `netbios-node-type` - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2. Broadcast and multicast are not supported. For more information about NetBIOS node types, see [RFC 2132](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt).\n- `ipv6-address-preferred-lease-time` - A value (in seconds, minutes, hours, or years) for how frequently a running instance with an IPv6 assigned to it goes through DHCPv6 lease renewal. Acceptable values are between 140 and 2147483647 seconds (approximately 68 years). If no value is entered, the default lease time is 140 seconds. If you use long-term addressing for EC2 instances, you can increase the lease time and avoid frequent lease renewal requests. Lease renewal typically occurs when half of the lease time has elapsed."

            Describes Reserved Instance offerings that are available for purchase. With Reserved Instances, you purchase the right to launch instances for a period of time. During that time period, you do not receive insufficient capacity errors, and you pay a lower usage rate than the rate charged for On-Demand instances for the actual time used.

            If you have listed your own Reserved Instances for sale in the Reserved Instance Marketplace, they will be excluded from these results. This is to ensure that you do not purchase your own Reserved Instances.

            For more information, see [Sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                The ID of the Availability Zone.

                Either `AvailabilityZone` or `AvailabilityZoneId` can be specified, but not both.
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            include-marketplace: Include Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings in the response.
            instance-tenancy: |-
                The tenancy of the instances covered by the reservation. A Reserved Instance with a tenancy of `dedicated` is applied to instances that run in a VPC on single-tenant hardware (i.e., Dedicated Instances).

                **Important:** The `host` value cannot be used with this parameter. Use the `default` or `dedicated` values only.

                Default: `default`
            instance-type: The instance type that the reservation will cover (for example, `m1.small`). For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            max-duration: |-

            max-instance-count: |-
                The maximum number of instances to filter when searching for offerings.

                Default: 20
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned `NextToken` value. The maximum is 100.

                Default: 100
            min-duration: |-
                The minimum duration (in seconds) to filter when searching for offerings.

            offering-class: The offering class of the Reserved Instance. Can be `standard` or `convertible`.
            offering-type: The Reserved Instance offering type. If you are using tools that predate the 2011-11-01 API version, you only have access to the `Medium Utilization` Reserved Instance offering type.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            product-description: The Reserved Instance product platform description. Instances that include `(Amazon VPC)` in the description are for use with Amazon VPC.
            reserved-instances-offering-ids: One or more Reserved Instances offering IDs.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).
            next-token: The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

            Associates a target network with a Client VPN endpoint. A target network is a subnet in a VPC. You can associate multiple subnets from the same VPC with a Client VPN endpoint. You can associate only one subnet in each Availability Zone. We recommend that you associate at least two subnets to provide Availability Zone redundancy.

            If you specified a VPC when you created the Client VPN endpoint or if you have previous subnet associations, the specified subnet must be in the same VPC. To specify a subnet that's in a different VPC, you must first modify the Client VPN endpoint ([ModifyClientVpnEndpoint]()) and change the VPC that's associated with it.

            Describes one or more IPAM policies.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            Describes one or more route servers.

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            allocation-default-netmask-length: The default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.
            allocation-max-netmask-length: The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.The maximum netmask length must be greater than the minimum netmask length.
            allocation-min-netmask-length: The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum netmask length.
            auto-import: |-
                If true, IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must not already be allocated to other resources in order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

                A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

            Gets the allocation rules for an IPAM policy.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            Allocation rules are optional configurations within an IPAM policy that map Amazon Web Services resource types to specific IPAM pools. If no rules are defined, the resource types default to using Amazon-provided IP addresses.

            Creates a new route server to manage dynamic routing in a VPC.

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

            - VPC route tables not associated with subnets
            - Subnet route tables
            - Internet gateway route tables

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use [Transit Gateway Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html).

            For more information see [Dynamic routing in your VPC with VPC Route Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/dynamic-routing-route-server.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            Enables or modifies the *block public access for snapshots* setting at the account level for the specified Amazon Web Services Region. After you enable block public access for snapshots in a Region, users can no longer request public sharing for snapshots in that Region. Snapshots that are already publicly shared are either treated as private or they remain publicly shared, depending on the **State** that you specify.

            Enabling block public access for snapshots in *block all sharing* mode does not change the permissions for snapshots that are already publicly shared. Instead, it prevents these snapshots from be publicly visible and publicly accessible. Therefore, the attributes for these snapshots still indicate that they are publicly shared, even though they are not publicly available.

            If you later disable block public access or change the mode to *block new sharing*, these snapshots will become publicly available again.

            For more information, see [Block public access for snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/block-public-access-snapshots.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request.

            You can only modify a Spot Fleet request of type `maintain`.

            While the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the `modifying` state.

            To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the Spot Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is `capacityOptimized`, Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

            To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the Spot Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is `capacityOptimized`, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

            If you are finished with your Spot Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active.

                If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group.

            tag-specifications: The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Instance request on creation. The value for `ResourceType` must be `spot-instances-request`, otherwise the Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot Instance request after it has been created, see [CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html).
            type: |-

                The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled.

                The specified start date and time cannot be equal to the current date and time. You must specify a start date and time that occurs after the current date and time.
            valid-until: |-
                The end date of the request, in UTC format (*YYYY*-*MM*-*DD*T*HH*:*MM*:*SS*Z).

                - For a persistent request, the request remains active until the `ValidUntil` date and time is reached. Otherwise, the request remains active until you cancel it.
                - For a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch, the request is canceled, or the `ValidUntil` date and time is reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days from the date the request was created.

        command: |-
            Creates a placement group in which to launch instances. The strategy of the placement group determines how the instances are organized within the group.

            A `cluster` placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput. A `spread` placement group places instances on distinct hardware. A `partition` placement group places groups of instances in different partitions, where instances in one partition do not share the same hardware with instances in another partition.

            For more information, see [Placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Disables the *block public access for snapshots* setting at the account level for the specified Amazon Web Services Region. After you disable block public access for snapshots in a Region, users can publicly share snapshots in that Region.

            Enabling block public access for snapshots in *block-all-sharing* mode does not change the permissions for snapshots that are already publicly shared. Instead, it prevents these snapshots from be publicly visible and publicly accessible. Therefore, the attributes for these snapshots still indicate that they are publicly shared, even though they are not publicly available.

            If you disable block public access , these snapshots will become publicly available again.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. You can restart your instance at any time using the [StartInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_StartInstances.html) API. For more information, see [Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. By default, this includes a graceful operating system (OS) shutdown. To bypass the graceful shutdown, use the `skipOsShutdown` parameter; however, this might risk data integrity.

            You can use the StopInstances operation together with the `Hibernate` parameter to hibernate an instance if the instance is [enabled for hibernation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enabling-hibernation.html) and meets the [hibernation prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernating-prerequisites.html). Stopping an instance doesn't preserve data stored in RAM, while hibernation does. If hibernation fails, a normal shutdown occurs. For more information, see [Hibernate your Amazon EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            If your instance appears stuck in the `stopping` state, there might be an issue with the underlying host computer. You can use the StopInstances operation together with the Force parameter to force stop your instance. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance stop issues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            Stopping and hibernating an instance differs from rebooting or terminating it. For example, a stopped or hibernated instance retains its root volume and any data volumes, unlike terminated instances where these volumes are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping, hibernating, rebooting, and terminating instances, see [Amazon EC2 instance state changes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            We don't charge for instance usage or data transfer fees when an instance is stopped. However, the root volume and any data volumes remain and continue to persist your data, and you're charged for volume usage. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, followed by per-second billing.

            You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances.

            max-results: The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned `nextToken` value.
            next-token: The token for the next page of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Creates an exact copy of an Amazon EBS snapshot.

            The location of the source snapshot determines whether you can copy it or not, and the allowed destinations for the snapshot copy.

            - If the source snapshot is in a Region, you can copy it within that Region, to another Region, to an Outpost associated with that Region, or to a Local Zone in that Region.
            - If the source snapshot is in a Local Zone, you can copy it within that Local Zone, to another Local Zone in the same zone group, or to the parent Region of the Local Zone.
            - If the source snapshot is on an Outpost, you can't copy it.

            When copying snapshots to a Region, the encryption outcome for the snapshot copy depends on the Amazon EBS encryption by default setting for the destination Region, the encryption status of the source snapshot, and the encryption parameters you specify in the request. For more information, see [Encryption and snapshot copying](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html#creating-encrypted-snapshots).

            Snapshots copied to an Outpost must be encrypted. Unencrypted snapshots are not supported on Outposts. For more information, [Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshots-outposts.html#considerations).

            Snapshots copies have an arbitrary source volume ID. Do not use this volume ID for any purpose.

                The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the HTTP request to (for example, `ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). With the CLI, this is specified using the `--region` parameter or the default Region in your Amazon Web Services configuration file.
            dry-run: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

            kms-key-id: |-
                The identifier of the KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the encrypted state must be `true`.

                You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:

                - Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
                - Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
                - Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
                - Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

                Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.
            presigned-url: |-
                When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see [Query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html).

                The `PresignedUrl` should use the snapshot source endpoint, the `CopySnapshot` action, and include the `SourceRegion`, `SourceSnapshotId`, and `DestinationRegion` parameters. The `PresignedUrl` must be signed using Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Modifies the customer gateway or the target gateway of an Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the following migration options are available:

            - An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway
            - An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway
            - An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway
            - An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway

            Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure the new gateway. Use [CreateVpnGateway]() to create a virtual private gateway, or [CreateTransitGateway]() to create a transit gateway.

            This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway.

            You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway.

            Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete.

            After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use [CreateRoute]() and [DeleteRoute]() to make the changes described in [Update VPC route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/modify-vpn-target.html#step-update-routing) in the *Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide*.

            When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use [CreateTransitGatewayRoute]() to add the routes.

            If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table.

            After you perform this operation, the VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the Amazon Web Services side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.

            Describes the status of the specified instances or all of your instances. By default, only running instances are described, unless you specifically indicate to return the status of all instances.

            Instance status includes the following components:

            - **Status checks** - Amazon EC2 performs status checks on running EC2 instances to identify hardware and software issues. For more information, see [Status checks for your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html) and [Troubleshoot instances with failed status checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            - **Scheduled events** - Amazon EC2 can schedule events (such as reboot, stop, or terminate) for your instances related to hardware issues, software updates, or system maintenance. For more information, see [Scheduled events for your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            - **Instance state** - You can manage your instances from the moment you launch them through their termination. For more information, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            - **SQL license exemption monitoring** - For instances registered with the SQL LE service, status includes SQL license exemption monitoring health and processing status to provide operational visibility into license exemption functionality.

            The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

            The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

                - `operator.managed` - A Boolean that indicates whether this is a managed instance.
                - `operator.principal` - The principal that manages the instance. Only valid for managed instances, where `managed` is `true`.
                - `system-status.reachability` - Filters on system status where the name is `reachability` (`passed` | `failed` | `initializing` | `insufficient-data`).

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

            A target can be an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within an Amazon Web Services Organization to which an IPAM policy can be applied.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).
            next-token: The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.

            Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the `busy` state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three. If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first.

            When a volume with an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance.

            You can't detach or force detach volumes that are attached to Amazon Web Services-managed resources. Attempting to do this results in the `UnsupportedOperationException` exception.

            For more information, see [Detach an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-detaching-volume.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            Allocates an Elastic IP address to your Amazon Web Services account. After you allocate the Elastic IP address you can associate it with an instance or network interface. After you release an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool and can be allocated to a different Amazon Web Services account.

            You can allocate an Elastic IP address from one of the following address pools:

            - Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses
            - Public IPv4 address range that you own and bring to your Amazon Web Services account using [Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html)
            - An IPv4 IPAM pool with an Amazon-provided or BYOIP public IPv4 address range
            - IPv4 addresses from your on-premises network made available for use with an Outpost using a [customer-owned IP address pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing) (CoIP pool)

            For more information, see [Elastic IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            If you release an Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released after it is allocated to another Amazon Web Services account. To attempt to recover an Elastic IP address that you released, specify it in this operation.

            You can allocate a carrier IP address which is a public IP address from a telecommunication carrier, to a network interface which resides in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone (for example an EC2 instance).

            address: The Elastic IP address to recover or an IPv4 address from an address pool.

            Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC.

            Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see [Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified bucket.

            For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            Attaches an Amazon EBS volume to a `running` or `stopped` instance, and exposes it to the instance with the specified device name.

            The maximum number of Amazon EBS volumes that you can attach to an instance depends on the instance type. If you exceed the volume attachment limit for an instance type, the attachment request fails with the `AttachmentLimitExceeded` error. For more information, see [Instance volume limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html).

            After you attach an EBS volume, you must make it available for use. For more information, see [Make an EBS volume available for use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-using-volumes.html).

            If a volume has an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product code:

            - The volume can be attached only to a stopped instance.
            - Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes are copied from the volume to the instance.
            - You must be subscribed to the product.
            - The instance type and operating system of the instance must support the product. For example, you can't detach a volume from a Windows instance and attach it to a Linux instance.

            For more information, see [Attach an Amazon EBS volume to an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-attaching-volume.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

            enable-primary-ipv6: If you’re creating a network interface in a dual-stack or IPv6-only subnet, you have the option to assign a primary IPv6 IP address. A primary IPv6 address is an IPv6 GUA address associated with an ENI that you have enabled to use a primary IPv6 address. Use this option if the instance that this ENI will be attached to relies on its IPv6 address not changing. Amazon Web Services will automatically assign an IPv6 address associated with the ENI attached to your instance to be the primary IPv6 address. Once you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, you cannot disable it. When you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be made the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated or the network interface is detached. If you have multiple IPv6 addresses associated with an ENI attached to your instance and you enable a primary IPv6 address, the first IPv6 GUA address associated with the ENI becomes the primary IPv6 address.

                The images available to you include public images, private images that you own, and private images owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit launch permissions.

                Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short interval and then return empty results. After all instances that reference a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the image will eventually return an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be found.

                When Allowed AMIs is set to `enabled`, only allowed images are returned in the results, with the `imageAllowed` field set to `true` for each image. In `audit-mode`, the `imageAllowed` field is set to `true` for images that meet the account's Allowed AMIs criteria, and `false` for images that don't meet the criteria. For more information, see [Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html).

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

                We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

                Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

                You can use `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` to find a running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is `fulfilled`, the instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance. Alternatively, you can use [DescribeInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances) with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is `spot`.

                We recommend that you set `MaxResults` to a value between 5 and 1000 to limit the number of items returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list more manageable and returns the items faster. If the list of items exceeds your `MaxResults` value, then that number of items is returned along with a `NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` request to retrieve the remaining items.

                Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.

                Retrieves the encrypted administrator password for a running Windows instance.

                The Windows password is generated at boot by the `EC2Config` service or `EC2Launch` scripts (Windows Server 2016 and later). This usually only happens the first time an instance is launched. For more information, see [EC2Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html) and [EC2Launch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2launch.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                For the `EC2Config` service, the password is not generated for rebundled AMIs unless `Ec2SetPassword` is enabled before bundling.

                The password is encrypted using the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance. You must provide the corresponding key pair file.

                When you launch an instance, password generation and encryption may take a few minutes. If you try to retrieve the password before it's available, the output returns an empty string. We recommend that you wait up to 15 minutes after launching an instance before trying to retrieve the generated password.

                Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you.

                The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions.

                The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

                - *public*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the `all` group. All Amazon Web Services accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.
                - *explicit*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.
                - *implicit*: An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.

                The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

                If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.

                If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the `OwnerIds` option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, `amazon` for snapshots owned by Amazon, or `self` for snapshots that you own.

                If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), `self` for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or `all` for public snapshots.

                If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).

                For more information about EBS snapshots, see [Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html) in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

                We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

                Describes the specified instances or all instances.

                If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

                The response includes SQL license exemption status information for instances registered with the SQL LE service, providing visibility into license exemption configuration and status.

                If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

                Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

                If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

                We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

                The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

                Describes the status of the specified instances or all of your instances. By default, only running instances are described, unless you specifically indicate to return the status of all instances.

                Instance status includes the following components:

                - **Status checks** - Amazon EC2 performs status checks on running EC2 instances to identify hardware and software issues. For more information, see [Status checks for your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html) and [Troubleshoot instances with failed status checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
                - **Scheduled events** - Amazon EC2 can schedule events (such as reboot, stop, or terminate) for your instances related to hardware issues, software updates, or system maintenance. For more information, see [Scheduled events for your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
                - **Instance state** - You can manage your instances from the moment you launch them through their termination. For more information, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
                - **SQL license exemption monitoring** - For instances registered with the SQL LE service, status includes SQL license exemption monitoring health and processing status to provide operational visibility into license exemption functionality.

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

                    Constraints: Maximum 100 explicitly specified instance IDs.
                max-items: |-
                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-results: |-
                    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).

                    You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same request.
                next-token: The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                Describes the specified instances or all instances.

                If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

                The response includes SQL license exemption status information for instances registered with the SQL LE service, providing visibility into license exemption configuration and status.

                If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

                Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

                If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

                We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

                The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

                Describes the specified instances or all instances.

                If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

                The response includes SQL license exemption status information for instances registered with the SQL LE service, providing visibility into license exemption configuration and status.

                If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

                Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

                If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.

                We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

                The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a particular order.

                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-results: |-
                    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).

                    You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same request.
                next-token: The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                Describes the specified instances or all instances.

                If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

                The response includes SQL license exemption status information for instances registered with the SQL LE service, providing visibility into license exemption configuration and status.

                If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

                Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

                If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run.

                The images available to you include public images, private images that you own, and private images owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit launch permissions.

                Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short interval and then return empty results. After all instances that reference a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the image will eventually return an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be found.

                When Allowed AMIs is set to `enabled`, only allowed images are returned in the results, with the `imageAllowed` field set to `true` for each image. In `audit-mode`, the `imageAllowed` field is set to `true` for images that meet the account's Allowed AMIs criteria, and `false` for images that don't meet the criteria. For more information, see [Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html).

                The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.
