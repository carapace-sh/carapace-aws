            max-results: The maximum number of results to return in a single call.
            next-token: The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. The first call does not contain any tokens.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

If an AWS Directory Service directory ID is specified, the organization alias must match the directory alias. If you choose not to associate an existing directory with your organization, then we create a new WorkMail directory for you. For more information, see [Adding an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/add_new_organization.html) in the *WorkMail Administrator Guide*.

            You can associate multiple email domains with an organization, then choose your default email domain from the WorkMail console. You can also associate a domain that is managed in an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone. For more information, see [Adding a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/add_domain.html) and [Choosing the default domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/default_domain.html) in the *WorkMail Administrator Guide*.

            Optionally, you can use a customer managed key from AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt email for your organization. If you don't associate an AWS KMS key, WorkMail creates a default, AWS managed key for you.
