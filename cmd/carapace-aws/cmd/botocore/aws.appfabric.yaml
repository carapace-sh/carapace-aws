                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use `nextToken` to obtain further pages of results.

                This is only an upper limit. The actual number of results returned per call might be fewer than the specified maximum.
            next-token: If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken error*.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

                If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use `nextToken` to obtain further pages of results.

                This is only an upper limit. The actual number of results returned per call might be fewer than the specified maximum.
            next-token: If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken error*.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
