            Create an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.

            Create multiple revisions of a configuration by calling this action multiple times using the same `AutoScalingConfigurationName`. The call returns incremental `AutoScalingConfigurationRevision` values. When you create a service and configure an auto scaling configuration resource, the service uses the latest active revision of the auto scaling configuration by default. You can optionally configure the service to use a specific revision.

            Configure a higher `MinSize` to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.

            Configure a lower `MaxSize` to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.
        flag:
            auto-scaling-configuration-name: |-
                A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates revision number `1` of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.

                Prior to the release of [Auto scale configuration enhancements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/release-2023-09-22-auto-scale-config.html), the name `DefaultConfiguration` was reserved.

                This restriction is no longer in place. You can now manage `DefaultConfiguration` the same way you manage your custom auto scaling configurations. This means you can do the following with the `DefaultConfiguration` that App Runner provides:

                - Create new revisions of the `DefaultConfiguration`.
                - Delete the revisions of the `DefaultConfiguration`.
                - Delete the auto scaling configuration for which the App Runner `DefaultConfiguration` was created.
                - If you delete the auto scaling configuration you can create another custom auto scaling configuration with the same `DefaultConfiguration` name. The original `DefaultConfiguration` resource provided by App Runner remains in your account unless you make changes to it.

You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.

                App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.

            Create an App Runner observability configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you want to enable non-default observability features. You can share an observability configuration across multiple services.

            Create multiple revisions of a configuration by calling this action multiple times using the same `ObservabilityConfigurationName`. The call returns incremental `ObservabilityConfigurationRevision` values. When you create a service and configure an observability configuration resource, the service uses the latest active revision of the observability configuration by default. You can optionally configure the service to use a specific revision.

            The observability configuration resource is designed to configure multiple features (currently one feature, tracing). This action takes optional parameters that describe the configuration of these features (currently one parameter, `TraceConfiguration`). If you don't specify a feature parameter, App Runner doesn't enable the feature.

        command: |-
            Update an App Runner service. You can update the source configuration and instance configuration of the service. You can also update the ARN of the auto scaling configuration resource that's associated with the service. However, you can't change the name or the encryption configuration of the service. These can be set only when you create the service.

            To update the tags applied to your service, use the separate actions [TagResource]() and [UntagResource]().

            This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use the returned `OperationId` and the [ListOperations]() call to track the operation's progress.
        flag:
            auto-scaling-configuration-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource that you want to associate with the App Runner service.

                The source configuration to apply to the App Runner service.

                You can change the configuration of the code or image repository that the service uses. However, you can't switch from code to image or the other way around. This means that you must provide the same structure member of `SourceConfiguration` that you originally included when you created the service. Specifically, you can include either `CodeRepository` or `ImageRepository`. To update the source configuration, set the values to members of the structure that you include.
