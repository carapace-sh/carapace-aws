            `PutPipelineDefinition` also validates the configuration as it adds it to the pipeline. Changes to the pipeline are saved unless one of the following three validation errors exists in the pipeline.

            1. An object is missing a name or identifier field.
            2. A string or reference field is empty.
            3. The number of objects in the pipeline exceeds the maximum allowed objects.
            4. The pipeline is in a FINISHED state.

            Pipeline object definitions are passed to the `PutPipelineDefinition` action and returned by the [GetPipelineDefinition]() action.

            name: The name for the pipeline. You can use the same name for multiple pipelines associated with your AWS account, because AWS Data Pipeline assigns each pipeline a unique pipeline identifier.
            tags: A list of tags to associate with the pipeline at creation. Tags let you control access to pipelines. For more information, see [Controlling User Access to Pipelines](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-control-access.html) in the *AWS Data Pipeline Developer Guide*.
            unique-id: A unique identifier. This identifier is not the same as the pipeline identifier assigned by AWS Data Pipeline. You are responsible for defining the format and ensuring the uniqueness of this identifier. You use this parameter to ensure idempotency during repeated calls to `CreatePipeline`. For example, if the first call to `CreatePipeline` does not succeed, you can pass in the same unique identifier and pipeline name combination on a subsequent call to `CreatePipeline`. `CreatePipeline` ensures that if a pipeline already exists with the same name and unique identifier, a new pipeline is not created. Instead, you'll receive the pipeline identifier from the previous attempt. The uniqueness of the name and unique identifier combination is scoped to the AWS account or IAM user credentials.

            Task runners call `PollForTask` to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a value for the `workerGroup` parameter. The task returned can come from any of the pipelines that match the `workerGroup` value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.

            If tasks are ready in the work queue, `PollForTask` returns a response immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, `PollForTask` uses long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds, during which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner. To accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The task runner should not call `PollForTask` again on the same `workerGroup` until it receives a response, and this can take up to 90 seconds.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            limit: The maximum number of object names that `QueryObjects` will return in a single call. The default value is 100.
            marker: The starting point for the results to be returned. For the first call, this value should be empty. As long as there are more results, continue to call `QueryObjects` with the marker value from the previous call to retrieve the next set of results.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            objects-query: The query that defines the objects to be returned. The `Query` object can contain a maximum of ten selectors. The conditions in the query are limited to top-level String fields in the object. These filters can be applied to components, instances, and attempts.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            pipeline-id: The ID of the pipeline.
            sphere: 'Indicates whether the query applies to components or instances. The possible values are: `COMPONENT`, `INSTANCE`, and `ATTEMPT`.'
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            Task runners call `ReportTaskProgress` when assigned a task to acknowledge that it has the task. If the web service does not receive this acknowledgement within 2 minutes, it assigns the task in a subsequent [PollForTask]() call. After this initial acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by specifying a `reportProgressTimeout` field in your pipeline.

            If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data Pipeline assumes that the task runner is unable to process the task and reassigns the task in a subsequent response to [PollForTask](). Task runners should call `ReportTaskProgress` every 60 seconds.
