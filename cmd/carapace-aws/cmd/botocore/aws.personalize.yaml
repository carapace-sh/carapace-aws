            Creates a recommender with the recipe (a Domain dataset group use case) you specify. You create recommenders for a Domain dataset group and specify the recommender's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when you make a [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) request.

            **Minimum recommendation requests per second**

            A high `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond` will increase your bill. We recommend starting with 1 for `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond` (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond` as necessary.

            When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's minimum recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation requests per second (`minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`) specifies the baseline recommendation request throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize. The default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is `1`. A recommendation request is a single `GetRecommendations` operation. Request throughput is measured in requests per second and Amazon Personalize uses your requests per second to derive your requests per hour and the price of your recommender usage.

            If your requests per second increases beyond `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of requests.

            Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based on minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) or the actual number of requests. The actual request throughput used is calculated as the average requests/second within a one-hour window. We recommend starting with the default `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond` as necessary.

            **Status**

            A recommender can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - STOP PENDING &gt; STOP IN\_PROGRESS &gt; INACTIVE &gt; START PENDING &gt; START IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE
            - DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN\_PROGRESS

            To get the recommender status, call [DescribeRecommender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeRecommender.html).

            Wait until the `status` of the recommender is `ACTIVE` before asking the recommender for recommendations.

A new version of the solution is created every time you call this operation.

            **Status**

            A solution version can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING
            - CREATE IN\_PROGRESS
            - ACTIVE
            - CREATE FAILED
            - CREATE STOPPING
            - CREATE STOPPED

            To get the status of the version, call [DescribeSolutionVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeSolutionVersion.html). Wait until the status shows as ACTIVE before calling `CreateCampaign`.

            If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a `failureReason` key, which describes why the job failed.

This updates the model to consider new items for recommendations. It is not a full retraining. You should still complete a full retraining weekly. If you specify `UPDATE`, Amazon Personalize will stop automatic updates for the solution version. To resume updates, create a new solution with training mode set to `FULL` and deploy it in a campaign.

            Describes a recipe.

            A recipe contains three items:

            - An algorithm that trains a model.
            - Hyperparameters that govern the training.
            - Feature transformation information for modifying the input data before training.

            Amazon Personalize provides a set of predefined recipes. You specify a recipe when you create a solution with the [CreateSolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSolution.html) API. `CreateSolution` trains a model by using the algorithm in the specified recipe and a training dataset. The solution, when deployed as a campaign, can provide recommendations using the [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) API.

            By default, all new solutions use automatic training. With automatic training, you incur training costs while your solution is active. To avoid unnecessary costs, when you are finished you can [update the solution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UpdateSolution.html) to turn off automatic training. For information about training costs, see [Amazon Personalize pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).

This configuration includes the recipe to use for model training and optional training configuration, such as columns to use in training and feature transformation parameters. For more information about configuring a solution, see [Creating and configuring a solution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/customizing-solution-config.html).

            By default, new solutions use automatic training to create solution versions every 7 days. You can change the training frequency. Automatic solution version creation starts within one hour after the solution is ACTIVE. If you manually create a solution version within the hour, the solution skips the first automatic training. For more information, see [Configuring automatic training](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/solution-config-auto-training.html).

            To turn off automatic training, set `performAutoTraining` to false. If you turn off automatic training, you must manually create a solution version by calling the [CreateSolutionVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSolutionVersion.html) operation.

            After training starts, you can get the solution version's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the [ListSolutionVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListSolutionVersions.html) API operation. To get its status, use the [DescribeSolutionVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeSolutionVersion.html).

            After training completes you can evaluate model accuracy by calling [GetSolutionMetrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_GetSolutionMetrics.html). When you are satisfied with the solution version, you deploy it using [CreateCampaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateCampaign.html). The campaign provides recommendations to a client through the [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) API.

            Amazon Personalize doesn't support configuring the `hpoObjective` for solution hyperparameter optimization at this time.

            **Status**

            A solution can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN\_PROGRESS

            To get the status of the solution, call [DescribeSolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeSolution.html). If you use manual training, the status must be ACTIVE before you call `CreateSolutionVersion`.

                We don't recommend enabling automated machine learning. Instead, match your use case to the available Amazon Personalize recipes. For more information, see [Choosing a recipe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/working-with-predefined-recipes.html).

                Whether to perform automated machine learning (AutoML). The default is `false`. For this case, you must specify `recipeArn`.

                When set to `true`, Amazon Personalize analyzes your training data and selects the optimal USER\_PERSONALIZATION recipe and hyperparameters. In this case, you must omit `recipeArn`. Amazon Personalize determines the optimal recipe by running tests with different values for the hyperparameters. AutoML lengthens the training process as compared to selecting a specific recipe.
            perform-auto-training: |-
                Whether the solution uses automatic training to create new solution versions (trained models). The default is `True` and the solution automatically creates new solution versions every 7 days. You can change the training frequency by specifying a `schedulingExpression` in the `AutoTrainingConfig` as part of solution configuration. For more information about automatic training, see [Configuring automatic training](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/solution-config-auto-training.html).

                Automatic solution version creation starts within one hour after the solution is ACTIVE. If you manually create a solution version within the hour, the solution skips the first automatic training.

                After training starts, you can get the solution version's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the [ListSolutionVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListSolutionVersions.html) API operation.

            There are 5 types of datasets:

            - Item interactions
            - Items
            - Users
            - Action interactions
            - Actions

            Each dataset type has an associated schema with required field types. Only the `Item interactions` dataset is required in order to train a model (also referred to as creating a solution).

            A dataset can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN\_PROGRESS

            To get the status of the dataset, call [DescribeDataset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataset.html).

            You incur campaign costs while it is active. To avoid unnecessary costs, make sure to delete the campaign when you are finished. For information about campaign costs, see [Amazon Personalize pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).

            Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version. When a client calls the [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) and [GetPersonalizedRanking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.html) APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.

            **Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling**

            A high `minProvisionedTPS` will increase your cost. We recommend starting with 1 for `minProvisionedTPS` (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the `minProvisionedTPS` as necessary.

            When you create an Amazon Personalize campaign, you can specify the minimum provisioned transactions per second (`minProvisionedTPS`) for the campaign. This is the baseline transaction throughput for the campaign provisioned by Amazon Personalize. It sets the minimum billing charge for the campaign while it is active. A transaction is a single `GetRecommendations` or `GetPersonalizedRanking` request. The default `minProvisionedTPS` is 1.

            If your TPS increases beyond the `minProvisionedTPS`, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below `minProvisionedTPS`. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. When your traffic reduces, capacity returns to the `minProvisionedTPS`.

            You are charged for the the minimum provisioned TPS or, if your requests exceed the `minProvisionedTPS`, the actual TPS. The actual TPS is the total number of recommendation requests you make. We recommend starting with a low `minProvisionedTPS`, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the `minProvisionedTPS` as necessary.

            For more information about campaign costs, see [Amazon Personalize pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).

            **Status**

            A campaign can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN\_PROGRESS

            To get the campaign status, call [DescribeCampaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeCampaign.html).

            Wait until the `status` of the campaign is `ACTIVE` before asking the campaign for recommendations.

            Creates a batch job that deletes all references to specific users from an Amazon Personalize dataset group in batches. You specify the users to delete in a CSV file of userIds in an Amazon S3 bucket. After a job completes, Amazon Personalize no longer trains on the users’ data and no longer considers the users when generating user segments. For more information about creating a data deletion job, see [Deleting users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/delete-records.html).

            - Your input file must be a CSV file with a single USER\_ID column that lists the users IDs. For more information about preparing the CSV file, see [Preparing your data deletion file and uploading it to Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/prepare-deletion-input-file.html).
            - To give Amazon Personalize permission to access your input CSV file of userIds, you must specify an IAM service role that has permission to read from the data source. This role needs `GetObject` and `ListBucket` permissions for the bucket and its content. These permissions are the same as importing data. For information on granting access to your Amazon S3 bucket, see [Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/granting-personalize-s3-access.html).

            After you create a job, it can take up to a day to delete all references to the users from datasets and models. Until the job completes, Amazon Personalize continues to use the data when training. And if you use a User Segmentation recipe, the users might appear in user segments.

            **Status**

            A data deletion job can have one of the following statuses:

            - PENDING &gt; IN\_PROGRESS &gt; COMPLETED -or- FAILED

            To get the status of the data deletion job, call [DescribeDataDeletionJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataDeletionJob.html) API operation and specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job. If the status is FAILED, the response includes a `failureReason` key, which describes why the job failed.

            Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset group. You will get an error if you call `CreateEventTracker` using the same dataset group as an existing event tracker.

            When you create an event tracker, the response includes a tracking ID, which you pass as a parameter when you use the [PutEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html) operation. Amazon Personalize then appends the event data to the Item interactions dataset of the dataset group you specify in your event tracker.

            The event tracker can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN\_PROGRESS

            To get the status of the event tracker, call [DescribeEventTracker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeEventTracker.html).

For user personalization, popular items, and personalized ranking solutions, the batch inference job generates a list of recommended items for each user ID in the input file. For related items solutions, the job generates a list of recommended items for each item ID in the input file.

        command: |-
            Creates a job that imports training data from your data source (an Amazon S3 bucket) to an Amazon Personalize dataset. To allow Amazon Personalize to import the training data, you must specify an IAM service role that has permission to read from the data source, as Amazon Personalize makes a copy of your data and processes it internally. For information on granting access to your Amazon S3 bucket, see [Giving Amazon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/granting-personalize-s3-access.html).

            If you already created a recommender or deployed a custom solution version with a campaign, how new bulk records influence recommendations depends on the domain use case or recipe that you use. For more information, see [How new data influences real-time recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/how-new-data-influences-recommendations.html).

            By default, a dataset import job replaces any existing data in the dataset that you imported in bulk. To add new records without replacing existing data, specify INCREMENTAL for the import mode in the CreateDatasetImportJob operation.

            **Status**

            A dataset import job can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

            To get the status of the import job, call [DescribeDatasetImportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetImportJob.html), providing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job. The dataset import is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a `failureReason` key, which describes why the job failed.

            Importing takes time. You must wait until the status shows as ACTIVE before training a model using the dataset.

            Updates a campaign to deploy a retrained solution version with an existing campaign, change your campaign's `minProvisionedTPS`, or modify your campaign's configuration. For example, you can set `enableMetadataWithRecommendations` to true for an existing campaign.

            To update a campaign to start automatically using the latest solution version, specify the following:

            - For the `SolutionVersionArn` parameter, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your solution in `SolutionArn/$LATEST` format.
            - In the `campaignConfig`, set `syncWithLatestSolutionVersion` to `true`.

            To update a campaign, the campaign status must be ACTIVE or CREATE FAILED. Check the campaign status using the [DescribeCampaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeCampaign.html) operation.

            You can still get recommendations from a campaign while an update is in progress. The campaign will use the previous solution version and campaign configuration to generate recommendations until the latest campaign update status is `Active`.

            Creates an empty dataset group. A dataset group is a container for Amazon Personalize resources. A dataset group can contain at most three datasets, one for each type of dataset:

            - Item interactions
            - Items
            - Users
            - Actions
            - Action interactions

            A dataset group can be a Domain dataset group, where you specify a domain and use pre-configured resources like recommenders, or a Custom dataset group, where you use custom resources, such as a solution with a solution version, that you deploy with a campaign. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can still add custom resources such as solutions and solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases and deployed with campaigns.

            A dataset group can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - DELETE PENDING

            To get the status of the dataset group, call [DescribeDatasetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetGroup.html). If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a `failureReason` key, which describes why the creation failed.

            You must wait until the `status` of the dataset group is `ACTIVE` before adding a dataset to the group.

            You can specify an Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the datasets in the group. If you specify a KMS key, you must also include an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permission to access the key.

            next-token: A token returned from the previous call to `ListDatasetImportJobs` for getting the next set of dataset import jobs (if they exist).
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Describes the given recommender, including its status.

            A recommender can be in one of the following states:

            - CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
            - STOP PENDING &gt; STOP IN\_PROGRESS &gt; INACTIVE &gt; START PENDING &gt; START IN\_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE
            - DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN\_PROGRESS

            When the `status` is `CREATE FAILED`, the response includes the `failureReason` key, which describes why.

            The `modelMetrics` key is null when the recommender is being created or deleted.

            For more information on recommenders, see [CreateRecommender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateRecommender.html).
