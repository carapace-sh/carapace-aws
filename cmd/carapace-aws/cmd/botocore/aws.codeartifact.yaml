        command: Deletes a package group. Deleting a package group does not delete packages or package versions associated with the package group. When a package group is deleted, the direct child package groups will become children of the package group's direct parent package group. Therefore, if any of the child groups are inheriting any settings from the parent, those settings could change.

                - Swift
                - generic

                <!--THE END-->

                - The namespace of a Maven package version is its `groupId`.

        command: |-
            Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. This API requires the `codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken` and `sts:GetServiceBearerToken` permissions. For more information about authorization tokens, see [CodeArtifact authentication and tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/tokens-authentication.html).

            CodeArtifact authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours when created with the `login` command. You can call `login` periodically to refresh the token. When you create an authorization token with the `GetAuthorizationToken` API, you can set a custom authorization period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the `durationSeconds` parameter.

            The authorization period begins after `login` or `GetAuthorizationToken` is called. If `login` or `GetAuthorizationToken` is called while assuming a role, the token lifetime is independent of the maximum session duration of the role. For example, if you call `sts assume-role` and specify a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a CodeArtifact authorization token, the token will be valid for the full authorization period even though this is longer than the 15-minute session duration.

            See [Using IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) for more information on controlling session duration.

            Sets the package origin configuration for a package.

            The package origin configuration determines how new versions of a package can be added to a repository. You can allow or block direct publishing of new package versions, or ingestion and retaining of new package versions from an external connection or upstream source. For more information about package origin controls and configuration, see [Editing package origin controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/package-origin-controls.html) in the *CodeArtifact User Guide*.

            `PutPackageOriginConfiguration` can be called on a package that doesn't yet exist in the repository. When called on a package that does not exist, a package is created in the repository with no versions and the requested restrictions are set on the package. This can be used to preemptively block ingesting or retaining any versions from external connections or upstream repositories, or to block publishing any versions of the package into the repository before connecting any package managers or publishers to the repository.

            Returns the most closely associated package group to the specified package. This API does not require that the package exist in any repository in the domain. As such, `GetAssociatedPackageGroup` can be used to see which package group's origin configuration applies to a package before that package is in a repository. This can be helpful to check if public packages are blocked without ingesting them.

            Creates a domain. CodeArtifact *domains* make it easier to manage multiple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to apply permissions across many repositories owned by different Amazon Web Services accounts. An asset is stored only once in a domain, even if it's in multiple repositories.

            Although you can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that your development teams can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-production domain to test changes to the production domain configuration.

An encryption key can be a key ID, a key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify an `encryptionKey`, your IAM role must have `kms:DescribeKey` and `kms:CreateGrant` permissions on the encryption key that is used.

        command: |-
            Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.

            You must specify `versions` or `versionRevisions`. You cannot specify both.
        flag:
            allow-overwrite: Set to true to overwrite a package version that already exists in the destination repository. If set to false and the package version already exists in the destination repository, the package version is returned in the `failedVersions` field of the response with an `ALREADY_EXISTS` error code.
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            destination-repository: The name of the repository into which package versions are copied.
            domain: The name of the domain that contains the source and destination repositories.
            domain-owner: The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.
            format: The format of the package versions to be copied.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            include-from-upstream: Set to true to copy packages from repositories that are upstream from the source repository to the destination repository. The default setting is false. For more information, see [Working with upstream repositories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/repos-upstream.html).
            namespace: |-
                The namespace of the package versions to be copied. The package component that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

                The namespace is required when copying package versions of the following formats:

                - Maven
                - Swift
                - generic

                <!--THE END-->

                - The namespace of a Maven package version is its `groupId`.
                - The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its `scope`.
                - The namespace of a generic package is its `namespace`.
                - Python, NuGet, Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not contain a corresponding component, package versions of those formats do not have a namespace.
            package: The name of the package that contains the versions to be copied.
            source-repository: The name of the repository that contains the package versions to be copied.
            version-revisions: |-
                A list of key-value pairs. The keys are package versions and the values are package version revisions. A `CopyPackageVersion` operation succeeds if the specified versions in the source repository match the specified package version revision.

                You must specify `versions` or `versionRevisions`. You cannot specify both.
            versions: |-
                The versions of the package to be copied.

                You must specify `versions` or `versionRevisions`. You cannot specify both.
