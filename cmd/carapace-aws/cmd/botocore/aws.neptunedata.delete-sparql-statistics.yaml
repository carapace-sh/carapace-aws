    Deletes SPARQL statistics

    When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must have a policy attached that allows the [neptune-db:DeleteStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/iam-dp-actions.html#deletestatistics) IAM action in that cluster.
