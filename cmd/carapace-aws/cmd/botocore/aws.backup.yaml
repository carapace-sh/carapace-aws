            Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the [Feature availability by resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource) table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

            Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

            If your lifecycle currently uses the parameters `DeleteAfterDays` and `MoveToColdStorageAfterDays`, include these parameters and their values when you call this operation. Not including them may result in your plan updating with null values.

            This operation does not support continuous backups.

            backup-vault-name: The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.

            Creates a tiering configuration.

            A tiering configuration enables automatic movement of backup data to a lower-cost storage tier based on the age of backed-up objects in the backup vault.

            Each vault can only have one vault-specific tiering configuration, in addition to any global configuration that applies to all vaults.

            This operation returns results depending on the resource type used in the value for `resourceArn`. For example, recovery points of Amazon DynamoDB with Advanced Settings have an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that begins with `arn:aws:backup`. Recovery points (backups) of DynamoDB without Advanced Settings enabled have an ARN that begins with `arn:aws:dynamodb`.

To prevent this exception, include only values representing resource types that are fully managed by Backup. These have an ARN that begins `arn:aws:backup` and they are noted in the [Feature availability by resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource) table.

            When an IAM role's permissions are insufficient to call this API, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body, but the recovery point is not deleted. Instead, it enters an `EXPIRED` state.

            `EXPIRED` recovery points can be deleted with this API once the IAM role has the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` action. To learn more about adding this role, see [Troubleshooting manual deletions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/deleting-backups.html#deleting-backups-troubleshooting).

            If the user or role is deleted or the permission within the role is removed, the deletion will not be successful and will enter an `EXPIRED` state.

            max-results: The maximum number of items to be returned.
            next-token: The next item following a partial list of returned items. For example, if a request is made to return `MaxResults` number of items, `NextToken` allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                The backup option for a selected resource. This option is only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs.

                Valid values: Set to `"WindowsVSS":"enabled"` to enable the `WindowsVSS` backup option and create a Windows VSS backup. Set to `"WindowsVSS""disabled"` to create a regular backup. The `WindowsVSS` option is not enabled by default.
            backup-vault-name: The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.

            complete-window-minutes: |-
                A value in minutes during which a successfully started backup must complete, or else Backup will cancel the job. This value is optional. This value begins counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It does not add additional time for `StartWindowMinutes`, or if the backup started later than scheduled.

                Like `StartWindowMinutes`, this parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            iam-role-arn: Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access`.
            idempotency-token: A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between otherwise identical calls to `StartBackupJob`. Retrying a successful request with the same idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.
            index: |-
                Include this parameter to enable index creation if your backup job has a resource type that supports backup indexes.

                Resource types that support backup indexes include:

                - `EBS` for Amazon Elastic Block Store
                - `S3` for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

                Index can have 1 of 2 possible values, either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`.

                To create a backup index for an eligible `ACTIVE` recovery point that does not yet have a backup index, set value to `ENABLED`.

                To delete a backup index, set value to `DISABLED`.
            lifecycle: |-
                The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

                Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

                Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the [Feature availability by resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource) table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

                This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (36,500 days).
            logically-air-gapped-backup-vault-arn: The ARN of a logically air-gapped vault. ARN must be in the same account and Region. If provided, supported fully managed resources back up directly to logically air-gapped vault, while other supported resources create a temporary (billable) snapshot in backup vault, then copy it to logically air-gapped vault. Unsupported resources only back up to the specified backup vault.
            recovery-point-tags: The tags to assign to the resources.
            resource-arn: An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.
            start-window-minutes: |-
                A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional, and the default is 8 hours. If this value is included, it must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

                This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).

                During the start window, the backup job status remains in `CREATED` status until it has successfully begun or until the start window time has run out. If within the start window time Backup receives an error that allows the job to be retried, Backup will automatically retry to begin the job at least every 10 minutes until the backup successfully begins (the job status changes to `RUNNING`) or until the job status changes to `EXPIRED` (which is expected to occur when the start window time is over).

                If this is set to `FALSE`, the response will contain all recovery points associated with the selected resource.

                Type: Boolean
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of items to be returned.

                Amazon RDS requires a value of at least 20.
            next-token: The next item following a partial list of returned items. For example, if a request is made to return `MaxResults` number of items, `NextToken` allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-arn: An ARN that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

    - name: put-backup-vault-lock-configuration
      description: Applies Backup Vault Lock to a backup vault, preventing attempts to delete any recovery point stored in or created in a backup vault.
      flags:
        --backup-vault-name=!: The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the name of the backup vault it protects.
        --changeable-for-days=: The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the number of days before the lock date.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Applies Backup Vault Lock to a backup vault, preventing attempts to delete any recovery point stored in or created in a backup vault. Vault Lock also prevents attempts to update the lifecycle policy that controls the retention period of any recovery point currently stored in a backup vault. If specified, Vault Lock enforces a minimum and maximum retention period for future backup and copy jobs that target a backup vault.

            Backup Vault Lock has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in environments that are subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations. For more information about how Backup Vault Lock relates to these regulations, see the [Cohasset Associates Compliance Assessment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/samples/cohassetreport.zip)

            For more information, see [Backup Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vault-lock.html).
        flag:
            backup-vault-name: The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the name of the backup vault it protects.
            changeable-for-days: |-
                The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the number of days before the lock date. For example, setting `ChangeableForDays` to 30 on Jan. 1, 2022 at 8pm UTC will set the lock date to Jan. 31, 2022 at 8pm UTC.

                Backup enforces a 72-hour cooling-off period before Vault Lock takes effect and becomes immutable. Therefore, you must set `ChangeableForDays` to 3 or greater.

                Before the lock date, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using `DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration` or change the Vault Lock configuration using `PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration`. On and after the lock date, the Vault Lock becomes immutable and cannot be changed or deleted.

                If this parameter is not specified, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using `DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration` or change the Vault Lock configuration using `PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration` at any time.

            max-retention-days: |-
                The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the maximum retention period that the vault retains its recovery points. This setting can be useful if, for example, your organization's policies require you to destroy certain data after retaining it for four years (1460 days).

                If this parameter is not included, Vault Lock does not enforce a maximum retention period on the recovery points in the vault. If this parameter is included without a value, Vault Lock will not enforce a maximum retention period.

                If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or shorter than the maximum retention period. If the job's retention period is longer than that maximum retention period, then the vault fails the backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The longest maximum retention period you can specify is 36500 days (approximately 100 years). Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.
            min-retention-days: |-
                The Backup Vault Lock configuration that specifies the minimum retention period that the vault retains its recovery points. This setting can be useful if, for example, your organization's policies require you to retain certain data for at least seven years (2555 days).

                This parameter is required when a vault lock is created through CloudFormation; otherwise, this parameter is optional. If this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock will not enforce a minimum retention period.

                If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or longer than the minimum retention period. If the job's retention period is shorter than that minimum retention period, then the vault fails that backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The shortest minimum retention period you can specify is 1 day. Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
