            Only one of `BudgetLimit` or `PlannedBudgetLimits` can be present in the syntax at one time. Use the syntax that matches your use case. The Request Syntax section shows the `BudgetLimit` syntax. For `PlannedBudgetLimits`, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_budgets_CreateBudget.html#API_CreateBudget_Examples) section.

            Similarly, only one set of filter and metric selections can be present in the syntax at one time. Either `FilterExpression` and `Metrics` or `CostFilters` and `CostTypes`, not both or a different combination. We recommend using `FilterExpression` and `Metrics` as they provide more flexible and powerful filtering capabilities. The Request Syntax section shows the `FilterExpression`/`Metrics` syntax.

            Updates a budget. You can change every part of a budget except for the `budgetName` and the `calculatedSpend`. When you modify a budget, the `calculatedSpend` drops to zero until Amazon Web Services has new usage data to use for forecasting.

            Only one of `BudgetLimit` or `PlannedBudgetLimits` can be present in the syntax at one time. Use the syntax that matches your case. The Request Syntax section shows the `BudgetLimit` syntax. For `PlannedBudgetLimits`, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_budgets_UpdateBudget.html#API_UpdateBudget_Examples) section.

            Similarly, only one set of filter and metric selections can be present in the syntax at one time. Either `FilterExpression` and `Metrics` or `CostFilters` and `CostTypes`, not both or a different combination. We recommend using `FilterExpression` and `Metrics` as they provide more flexible and powerful filtering capabilities. The Request Syntax section shows the `FilterExpression`/`Metrics` syntax.

    command: |-
        Use the Amazon Web Services Budgets API to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations. This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for the Amazon Web Services Budgets feature.

        Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:

        - How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits
        - Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your Reserved Instances (RIs)
        - Your current estimated charges from Amazon Web Services, and how much your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month
        - How much of your budget has been used

        Amazon Web Services updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create the following types of budgets:

        - **Cost budgets** - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.
        - **Usage budgets** - Plan how much you want to use one or more services.
        - **RI utilization budgets** - Define a utilization threshold, and receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.
        - **RI coverage budgets** - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts when the number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below that threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by a reservation.

        Service Endpoint

        The Amazon Web Services Budgets API provides the following endpoint:

        - https://budgets.amazonaws.com

        For information about costs that are associated with the Amazon Web Services Budgets API, see [Amazon Web Services Cost Management Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).
