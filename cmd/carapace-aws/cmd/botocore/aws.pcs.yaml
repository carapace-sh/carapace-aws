                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use `nextToken` to obtain further pages of results. The default is 10 results, and the maximum allowed page size is 100 results. A value of 0 uses the default.
            next-token: The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page of results returned. If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token returns an `HTTP 400 InvalidToken` error.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

      documentation:
        command: Creates a managed set of compute nodes. You associate a compute node group with a cluster through 1 or more PCS queues or as part of the login fleet. A compute node group includes the definition of the compute properties and lifecycle management. PCS uses the information you provide to this API action to launch compute nodes in your account. You can only specify subnets in the same Amazon VPC as your cluster. You receive billing charges for the compute nodes that PCS launches in your account. You must already have a launch template before you call this API. For more information, see [Launch an instance from a launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux Instances*.
        flag:
            ami-id: The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that PCS uses to launch compute nodes (Amazon EC2 instances). If you don't provide this value, PCS uses the AMI ID specified in the custom launch template.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.

            client-token: A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API request completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, the subsequent retries with the same client token return the result from the original successful request and they have no additional effect. If you don't specify a client token, the CLI and SDK automatically generate 1 for you.

            iam-instance-profile-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM instance profile used to pass an IAM role when launching EC2 instances. The role contained in your instance profile must have the `pcs:RegisterComputeNodeGroupInstance` permission and the role name must start with `AWSPCS` or must have the path `/aws-pcs/`. For more information, see [IAM instance profiles for PCS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/security-instance-profiles.html) in the *PCS User Guide*.
            instance-configs: A list of EC2 instance configurations that PCS can provision in the compute node group.
            purchase-option: Specifies how EC2 instances are purchased on your behalf. PCS supports On-Demand Instances, Spot Instances, and Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 billing and purchasing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*. For more information about PCS support for Capacity Blocks, see [Using Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML with PCS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/capacity-blocks.html) in the *PCS User Guide*. If you don't provide this option, it defaults to On-Demand.

        Parallel Computing Service (PCS) is a managed service that makes it easier for you to run and scale your high performance computing (HPC) workloads, and build scientific and engineering models on Amazon Web Services using Slurm. For more information, see the [Parallel Computing Service User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide).

        This reference describes the actions and data types of the service management API. You can use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call the API actions in software, or use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to call the API actions manually. These API actions manage the service through an Amazon Web Services account.

        The API actions operate on PCS resources. A *resource* is an entity in Amazon Web Services that you can work with. Amazon Web Services services create resources when you use the features of the service. Examples of PCS resources include clusters, compute node groups, and queues. For more information about resources in Amazon Web Services, see [Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-resource) in the *Resource Explorer User Guide*.

        An PCS *compute node* is an Amazon EC2 instance. You don't launch compute nodes directly. PCS uses configuration information that you provide to launch compute nodes in your Amazon Web Services account. You receive billing charges for your running compute nodes. PCS automatically terminates your compute nodes when you delete the PCS resources related to those compute nodes.
