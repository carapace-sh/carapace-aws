            Sets or updates the AWS IoT Events logging options.

            If you update the value of any `loggingOptions` field, it takes up to one minute for the change to take effect. If you change the policy attached to the role you specified in the `roleArn` field (for example, to correct an invalid policy), it takes up to five minutes for that change to take effect.
