If set to `SERVICE`, Amazon MWAA will create and manage the required VPC endpoints in your VPC. If set to `CUSTOMER`, you must create, and manage, the VPC endpoints for your VPC. If you choose to create an environment in a shared VPC, you must set this value to `CUSTOMER`. In a shared VPC deployment, the environment will remain in `PENDING` status until you create the VPC endpoints. If you do not take action to create the endpoints within 72 hours, the status will change to `CREATE_FAILED`. You can delete the failed environment and create a new one.

            max-webservers: |-
                The maximum number of web servers that you want to run in your environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web servers up to the number you specify for `MaxWebservers` when you interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Airflow REST API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. For example, in scenarios where your workload requires network calls to the Apache Airflow REST API with a high transaction-per-second (TPS) rate, Amazon MWAA will increase the number of web servers up to the number set in `MaxWebserers`. As TPS rates decrease Amazon MWAA disposes of the additional web servers, and scales down to the number set in `MinxWebserers`.

                Valid values: For environments larger than mw1.micro, accepts values from `2` to `5`. Defaults to `2` for all environment sizes except mw1.micro, which defaults to `1`.
            max-workers: The maximum number of workers that you want to run in your environment. MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow workers up to the number you specify in the `MaxWorkers` field. For example, `20`. When there are no more tasks running, and no more in the queue, MWAA disposes of the extra workers leaving the one worker that is included with your environment, or the number you specify in `MinWorkers`.
            min-webservers: |-
                The minimum number of web servers that you want to run in your environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web servers up to the number you specify for `MaxWebservers` when you interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Airflow REST API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. As the transaction-per-second rate, and the network load, decrease, Amazon MWAA disposes of the additional web servers, and scales down to the number set in `MinxWebserers`.

                Valid values: For environments larger than mw1.micro, accepts values from `2` to `5`. Defaults to `2` for all environment sizes except mw1.micro, which defaults to `1`.
            min-workers: The minimum number of workers that you want to run in your environment. MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow workers up to the number you specify in the `MaxWorkers` field. When there are no more tasks running, and no more in the queue, MWAA disposes of the extra workers leaving the worker count you specify in the `MinWorkers` field. For example, `2`.
            name: The name of the Amazon MWAA environment. For example, `MyMWAAEnvironment`.
            network-configuration: The VPC networking components used to secure and enable network traffic between the Amazon Web Services resources for your environment.

            max-webservers: |-
                The maximum number of web servers that you want to run in your environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web servers up to the number you specify for `MaxWebservers` when you interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Airflow REST API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. For example, in scenarios where your workload requires network calls to the Apache Airflow REST API with a high transaction-per-second (TPS) rate, Amazon MWAA will increase the number of web servers up to the number set in `MaxWebserers`. As TPS rates decrease Amazon MWAA disposes of the additional web servers, and scales down to the number set in `MinxWebserers`.

                Valid values: For environments larger than mw1.micro, accepts values from `2` to `5`. Defaults to `2` for all environment sizes except mw1.micro, which defaults to `1`.
            max-workers: The maximum number of workers that you want to run in your environment. MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow workers up to the number you specify in the `MaxWorkers` field. For example, `20`. When there are no more tasks running, and no more in the queue, MWAA disposes of the extra workers leaving the one worker that is included with your environment, or the number you specify in `MinWorkers`.
            min-webservers: |-
                The minimum number of web servers that you want to run in your environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web servers up to the number you specify for `MaxWebservers` when you interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Airflow REST API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. As the transaction-per-second rate, and the network load, decrease, Amazon MWAA disposes of the additional web servers, and scales down to the number set in `MinxWebserers`.

                Valid values: For environments larger than mw1.micro, accepts values from `2` to `5`. Defaults to `2` for all environment sizes except mw1.micro, which defaults to `1`.
            min-workers: The minimum number of workers that you want to run in your environment. MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow workers up to the number you specify in the `MaxWorkers` field.
