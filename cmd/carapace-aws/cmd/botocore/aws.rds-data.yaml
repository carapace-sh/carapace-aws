            Starts a SQL transaction.

            A transaction can run for a maximum of 24 hours. A transaction is terminated and rolled back automatically after 24 hours.

            A transaction times out if no calls use its transaction ID in three minutes. If a transaction times out before it's committed, it's rolled back automatically.

            For Aurora MySQL, DDL statements inside a transaction cause an implicit commit. We recommend that you run each MySQL DDL statement in a separate `ExecuteStatement` call with `continueAfterTimeout` enabled.

            Runs a batch SQL statement over an array of data.

            You can run bulk update and insert operations for multiple records using a DML statement with different parameter sets. Bulk operations can provide a significant performance improvement over individual insert and update operations.

            If a call isn't part of a transaction because it doesn't include the `transactionID` parameter, changes that result from the call are committed automatically.

            There isn't a fixed upper limit on the number of parameter sets. However, the maximum size of the HTTP request submitted through the Data API is 4 MiB. If the request exceeds this limit, the Data API returns an error and doesn't process the request. This 4-MiB limit includes the size of the HTTP headers and the JSON notation in the request. Thus, the number of parameter sets that you can include depends on a combination of factors, such as the size of the SQL statement and the size of each parameter set.

            The response size limit is 1 MiB. If the call returns more than 1 MiB of response data, the call is terminated.
