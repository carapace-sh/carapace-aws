            Removes session information for a specified bot, alias, and user ID.

            You can use this operation to restart a conversation with a bot. When you remove a session, the entire history of the session is removed so that you can start again.

            You don't need to delete a session. Sessions have a time limit and will expire. Set the session time limit when you create the bot. The default is 5 minutes, but you can specify anything between 1 minute and 24 hours.

            If you specify a bot or alias ID that doesn't exist, you receive a `BadRequestException.`

            If the locale doesn't exist in the bot, or if the locale hasn't been enables for the alias, you receive a `BadRequestException`.
        flag:
            bot-alias-id: The alias identifier in use for the bot that contains the session data.
            bot-id: The identifier of the bot that contains the session data.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
