            max-results: An optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of results to return. You can use `nextToken` to get the next page of results. The default is 100.
            next-token: If your initial `ListUsageLimits` operation returns a `nextToken`, you can include the returned `nextToken` in following `ListUsageLimits` operations, which returns results in the next page.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: An optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of results to return. You can use `nextToken` to display the next page of results.

            namespace-name: The namespace from which to list all snapshots.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            start-time: The time when the creation of the snapshot was initiated.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
