        command: |-
            When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically creates a resource share of `featureSet`=`CREATED_FROM_POLICY` with a managed permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be modified by using RAM.

            This operation creates a separate, fully manageable customer managed permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. You can associate this customer managed permission to any resource shares.

            Before you use [PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy](), you should first run this operation to ensure that you have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with the promoted resource share.

            - The original `CREATED_FROM_POLICY` policy isn't deleted, and resource shares using that original policy aren't automatically updated.
            - You can't modify a `CREATED_FROM_POLICY` resource share so you can't associate the new customer managed permission by using `ReplacePermsissionAssociations`. However, if you use [PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy](), that operation automatically associates the fully manageable customer managed permission to the newly promoted `STANDARD` resource share.
            - After you promote a resource share, if the original `CREATED_FROM_POLICY` managed permission has no other associations to A resource share, then RAM automatically deletes it.

We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

                If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

Include the specified value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a `NextToken` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's `NextToken` response to request the next page of results.

                A string in JSON format string that contains the following elements of a resource-based policy:

                - **Effect**: must be set to `ALLOW`.
                - **Action**: specifies the actions that are allowed by this customer managed permission. The list must contain only actions that are supported by the specified resource type. For a list of all actions supported by each resource type, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
                - **Condition**: (optional) specifies conditional parameters that must evaluate to true when a user attempts an action for that action to be allowed. For more information about the Condition element, see [IAM policies: Condition element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

                This template can't include either the `Resource` or `Principal` elements. Those are both filled in by RAM when it instantiates the resource-based policy on each resource shared using this managed permission. The `Resource` comes from the ARN of the specific resource that you are sharing. The `Principal` comes from the list of identities added to the resource share.

            Enables resource sharing within your organization in Organizations. This operation creates a service-linked role called `AWSServiceRoleForResourceAccessManager` that has the IAM managed policy named AWSResourceAccessManagerServiceRolePolicy attached. This role permits RAM to retrieve information about the organization and its structure. This lets you share resources with all of the accounts in the calling account's organization by specifying the organization ID, or all of the accounts in an organizational unit (OU) by specifying the OU ID. Until you enable sharing within the organization, you can specify only individual Amazon Web Services accounts, or for supported resource types, IAM roles and users.

            You must call this operation from an IAM role or user in the organization's management account.

            When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically creates a resource share of `featureSet`=`CREATED_FROM_POLICY` with a managed permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be modified by using RAM.

            This operation promotes the resource share to a `STANDARD` resource share that is fully manageable in RAM. When you promote a resource share, you can then manage the resource share in RAM and it becomes visible to all of the principals you shared it with.

            Before you perform this operation, you should first run [PromotePermissionCreatedFromPolicy]()to ensure that you have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with this resource share after its is promoted. If this operation can't find a managed permission that exactly matches the existing `CREATED_FROM_POLICY` permission, then this operation fails.

      description: Designates the specified version number as the default version for the specified customer managed permission.
      flags:
        --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided.
        --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided.
        --client-token=: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.
        --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.
        --permission-arn=!: Specifies the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the customer managed permission whose default version you want to change.
        --permission-version=!: Specifies the version number that you want to designate as the default for customer managed permission.
      documentation:
        command: Designates the specified version number as the default version for the specified customer managed permission. New resource shares automatically use this new default permission. Existing resource shares continue to use their original permission version, but you can use [ReplacePermissionAssociations]() to update them.

            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            client-token: |-
                Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

                If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

        --tags=!: A list of one or more tag key and value pairs.
      documentation:
        command: |-
            Adds the specified tag keys and values to a resource share or managed permission. If you choose a resource share, the tags are attached to only the resource share, not to the resources that are in the resource share.

            The tags on a managed permission are the same for all versions of the managed permission.

        This is the *Resource Access Manager API Reference*. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire organization or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users.

        To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:
