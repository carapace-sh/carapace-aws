            Updates the bundle, or storage plan, of an existing Amazon Lightsail bucket.

            A bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost, storage space, and data transfer quota for a bucket. You can update a bucket's bundle only one time within a monthly Amazon Web Services billing cycle. To determine if you can update a bucket's bundle, use the [GetBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/2016-11-28/api-reference/API_GetBuckets.html) action. The `ableToUpdateBundle` parameter in the response will indicate whether you can currently update a bucket's bundle.

            Update a bucket's bundle if it's consistently going over its storage space or data transfer quota, or if a bucket's usage is consistently in the lower range of its storage space or data transfer quota. Due to the unpredictable usage fluctuations that a bucket might experience, we strongly recommend that you update a bucket's bundle only as a long-term strategy, instead of as a short-term, monthly cost-cutting measure. Choose a bucket bundle that will provide the bucket with ample storage space and data transfer for a long time to come.

            Creates a snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a Lightsail instance.

            You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending.

            You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the `instance name` parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk.

            The `create disk snapshot` operation supports tag-based access control via request tags. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).

                - `Maximum` - The highest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your application.
                - `Sum` - The sum of all values submitted for the matching metric. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric.
                - `Average` - The value of `Sum` / `SampleCount` during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the `Minimum` and `Maximum` values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the `Minimum` and `Maximum` values. This comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your resources.
                - `SampleCount` - The count, or number, of data points used for the statistical calculation.

            Exports an Amazon Lightsail instance or block storage disk snapshot to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). This operation results in an export snapshot record that can be used with the `create cloud formation stack` operation to create new Amazon EC2 instances.

            Exported instance snapshots appear in Amazon EC2 as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and the instance system disk appears as an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Exported disk snapshots appear in Amazon EC2 as Amazon EBS volumes. Snapshots are exported to the same Amazon Web Services Region in Amazon EC2 as the source Lightsail snapshot.

            The `export snapshot` operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by `source snapshot name`. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).

            Stops a specific database that is currently running in Amazon Lightsail.

            If you don't manually start your database instance after it has been stopped for seven consecutive days, Amazon Lightsail automatically starts it for you. This action helps ensure that your database instance doesn't fall behind on any required maintenance updates.

            The `stop relational database` operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relationalDatabaseName. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).

            metric-name: "The metric for which you want to return information.\n\nValid instance metric names are listed below, along with the most useful `statistics` to include in your request, and the published `unit` value.\n\n- **`BurstCapacityPercentage`** - The percentage of CPU performance available for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity stops accruing when your instance's `BurstCapacityPercentage` reaches 100%. For more information, see [Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-burst-capacity).\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistics are `Maximum` and `Average`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Percent`.\n- **`BurstCapacityTime`** - The available amount of time for your instance to burst at 100% CPU utilization. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity time stops accruing when your instance's `BurstCapacityPercentage` metric reaches 100%.\n  \n  Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For example, if your instance operates at 50% CPU utilization in the burstable zone for a 5-minute period, then it consumes CPU burst capacity minutes at a 50% rate in that period. Your instance consumed 2 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU burst capacity minutes in the 5-minute period. For more information, see [Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-burst-capacity).\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistics are `Maximum` and `Average`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Seconds`.\n- **`CPUUtilization`** - The percentage of allocated compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistics are `Maximum` and `Average`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Percent`.\n- **`NetworkIn`** - The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Bytes`.\n- **`NetworkOut`** - The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes sent during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Bytes`.\n- **`StatusCheckFailed`** - Reports whether the instance passed or failed both the instance status check and the system status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`.\n- **`StatusCheckFailed_Instance`** - Reports whether the instance passed or failed the instance status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`.\n- **`StatusCheckFailed_System`** - Reports whether the instance passed or failed the system status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`.\n- **`MetadataNoToken`** - Reports the number of times that the instance metadata service was successfully accessed without a token. This metric determines if there are any processes accessing instance metadata by using Instance Metadata Service Version 1, which doesn't use a token. If all requests use token-backed sessions, such as Instance Metadata Service Version 2, then the value is 0.\n  \n  `Statistics`: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.\n  \n  `Unit`: The published unit is `Count`."

                The following statistics are available:

                - `Minimum` - The lowest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your application.
                - `Maximum` - The highest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your application.
                - `Sum` - All values submitted for the matching metric added together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric.
                - `Average` - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your resources.
                - `SampleCount` - The count, or number, of data points used for the statistical calculation.
            unit: The unit for the metric data request. Valid units depend on the metric data being requested. For the valid units to specify with each available metric, see the `metricName` parameter.

        command: |-
            Creates or updates an alarm, and associates it with the specified metric.

            An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your resources. When a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon Lightsail console. For more information, see [Alarms in Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-alarms).

            When this action creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.

            When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm. The alarm is then evaluated with the updated configuration.
        flag:
            alarm-name: The name for the alarm. Specify the name of an existing alarm to update, and overwrite the previous configuration of the alarm.
            cli-input-json: |-

                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.

                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            comparison-operator: The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic to the threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.
            contact-protocols: |-
                The contact protocols to use for the alarm, such as `Email`, `SMS` (text messaging), or both.

                A notification is sent via the specified contact protocol if notifications are enabled for the alarm, and when the alarm is triggered.

                A notification is not sent if a contact protocol is not specified, if the specified contact protocol is not configured in the Amazon Web Services Region, or if notifications are not enabled for the alarm using the `notificationEnabled` paramater.

                Use the `CreateContactMethod` action to configure a contact protocol in an Amazon Web Services Region.
            datapoints-to-alarm: The number of data points that must be not within the specified threshold to trigger the alarm. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value (`datapointsToAlarm`) is the M.
            evaluation-periods: |-
                The number of most recent periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value (`evaluationPeriods`) is the N.

                If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies the rolling period of time in which data points are evaluated.

                Each evaluation period is five minutes long. For example, specify an evaluation period of 24 to evaluate a metric over a rolling period of two hours.

                You can specify a minimum valuation period of 1 (5 minutes), and a maximum evaluation period of 288 (24 hours).
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            metric-name: |-
                The name of the metric to associate with the alarm.

                You can configure up to two alarms per metric.

                The following metrics are available for each resource type:

                - **Instances**: `BurstCapacityPercentage`, `BurstCapacityTime`, `CPUUtilization`, `NetworkIn`, `NetworkOut`, `StatusCheckFailed`, `StatusCheckFailed_Instance`, and `StatusCheckFailed_System`.
                - **Load balancers**: `ClientTLSNegotiationErrorCount`, `HealthyHostCount`, `UnhealthyHostCount`, `HTTPCode_LB_4XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_LB_5XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_2XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_3XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_4XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_5XX_Count`, `InstanceResponseTime`, `RejectedConnectionCount`, and `RequestCount`.
                - **Relational databases**: `CPUUtilization`, `DatabaseConnections`, `DiskQueueDepth`, `FreeStorageSpace`, `NetworkReceiveThroughput`, and `NetworkTransmitThroughput`.

                For more information about these metrics, see [Metrics available in Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-resource-health-metrics#available-metrics).
            monitored-resource-name: |-
                The name of the Lightsail resource that will be monitored.

                Instances, load balancers, and relational databases are the only Lightsail resources that can currently be monitored by alarms.
            notification-enabled: |-
                Indicates whether the alarm is enabled.

                Notifications are enabled by default if you don't specify this parameter.
            notification-triggers: |-
                The alarm states that trigger a notification.

                An alarm has the following possible states:

                - `ALARM` - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.
                - `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` - The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.
                - `OK` - The metric is within the defined threshold.

                When you specify a notification trigger, the `ALARM` state must be specified. The `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` and `OK` states can be specified in addition to the `ALARM` state.

                - If you specify `OK` as an alarm trigger, a notification is sent when the alarm switches from an `ALARM` or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` alarm state to an `OK` state. This can be thought of as an *all clear* alarm notification.
                - If you specify `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` as the alarm trigger, a notification is sent when the alarm switches from an `OK` or `ALARM` alarm state to an `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

                The notification trigger defaults to `ALARM` if you don't specify this parameter.
            threshold: The value against which the specified statistic is compared.
            treat-missing-data: |-
                Sets how this alarm will handle missing data points.

                An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:

                - `breaching` - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold. Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.
                - `notBreaching` - Assume the missing data is within the threshold. Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.
                - `ignore` - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm state.
                - `missing` - Missing data is treated as missing.

                If `treatMissingData` is not specified, the default behavior of `missing` is used.

                The power specification for the container service.

                The power specifies the amount of memory, vCPUs, and base monthly cost of each node of the container service. The `power` and `scale` of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the `power` with the `scale` (the number of nodes) of the service.

                Use the `GetContainerServicePowers` action to get a list of power options that you can specify using this parameter, and their base monthly cost.

                The public domain names to use with the container service, such as `example.com` and `www.example.com`.

                You can specify up to four public domain names for a container service. The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service.

                If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service.

                You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the `CreateCertificate` action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service.

                You can specify public domain names using a string to array map as shown in the example later on this page.
            scale: |-
                The scale specification for the container service.

                The scale specifies the allocated compute nodes of the container service. The `power` and `scale` of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the `power` with the `scale` (the number of nodes) of the service.
            service-name: |-
                The name for the container service.

                The name that you specify for your container service will make up part of its default domain. The default domain of a container service is typically `https://<ServiceName>.<RandomGUID>.<AWSRegion>.cs.amazonlightsail.com`. If the name of your container service is `container-service-1`, and it's located in the US East (Ohio) Amazon Web Services Region (`us-east-2`), then the domain for your container service will be like the following example: `https://container-service-1.ur4EXAMPLE2uq.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com`

                The following are the requirements for container service names:

                - Must be unique within each Amazon Web Services Region in your Lightsail account.
                - Must contain 1 to 63 characters.
                - Must contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
                - A hyphen (-) can separate words but cannot be at the start or end of the name.

If you push and register another container image to the same Lightsail container service, with the same label, then the version number for the new registered container image will be `2`. If you push and register another container image, the version number will be `3`, and so on.

            Creates a Lightsail load balancer. To learn more about deciding whether to load balance your application, see [Configure your Lightsail instances for load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/configure-lightsail-instances-for-load-balancing). You can create up to 10 load balancers per AWS Region in your account.

            When you create a load balancer, you can specify a unique name and port settings. To change additional load balancer settings, use the `UpdateLoadBalancerAttribute` operation.

            The `create load balancer` operation supports tag-based access control via request tags. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).
