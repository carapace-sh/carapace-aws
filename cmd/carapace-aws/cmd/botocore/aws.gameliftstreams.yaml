        command: |-
            Add locations that can host stream sessions. To add a location, the stream group must be in `ACTIVE` status. You configure locations and their corresponding capacity for each stream group. Creating a stream group in a location that's nearest to your end users can help minimize latency and improve quality.

            This operation provisions stream capacity at the specified locations. By default, all locations have 1 or 2 capacity, depending on the stream class option: 2 for 'High' and 1 for 'Ultra' and 'Win2022'. This operation also copies the content files of all associated applications to an internal S3 bucket at each location. This allows Amazon GameLift Streams to host performant stream sessions.

        command: |-
            Export the files that your application modifies or generates in a stream session, which can help you debug or verify your application. When your application runs, it generates output files such as logs, diagnostic information, crash dumps, save files, user data, screenshots, and so on. The files can be defined by the engine or frameworks that your application uses, or information that you've programmed your application to output.

            You can only call this action on a stream session that is in progress, specifically in one of the following statuses `ACTIVE`, `CONNECTED`, `PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`, and `RECONNECTING`. You must provide an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store the files in. When the session ends, Amazon GameLift Streams produces a compressed folder that contains all of the files and directories that were modified or created by the application during the stream session. AWS uses your security credentials to authenticate and authorize access to your Amazon S3 bucket.

            Amazon GameLift Streams collects the following generated and modified files. Find them in the corresponding folders in the `.zip` archive.

            - `application/`: The folder where your application or game is stored.

            <!--THE END-->

            - `profile/`: The user profile folder.
            - `temp/`: The system temp folder.

            To verify the status of the exported files, use GetStreamSession.

            To delete the files, delete the object in the S3 bucket.

Within a stream group, you specify an application to stream, streaming locations and their capacity, and the stream class you want to use when streaming applications to your end-users. A stream class defines the hardware configuration of the compute resources that Amazon GameLift Streams will use when streaming, such as the CPU, GPU, and memory.

            Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. There are two types of capacity, always-on and on-demand:

            - **Always-on**: The streaming capacity that is allocated and ready to handle stream requests without delay. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use or not. Best for quickest time from streaming request to streaming session. Default is 1 (2 for high stream classes) when creating a stream group or adding a location.
            - **On-demand**: The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location.

            Values for capacity must be whole number multiples of the tenancy value of the stream group's stream class.

            To adjust the capacity of any `ACTIVE` stream group, call [UpdateStreamGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html).

            If the `CreateStreamGroup` request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams assigns a unique ID to the stream group resource and sets the status to `ACTIVATING`. It can take a few minutes for Amazon GameLift Streams to finish creating the stream group while it searches for unallocated compute resources and provisions them. When complete, the stream group status will be `ACTIVE` and you can start stream sessions by using [StartStreamSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_StartStreamSession.html). To check the stream group's status, call [GetStreamGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamGroup.html).

            Stream groups should be recreated every 3-4 weeks to pick up important service updates and fixes. Stream groups that are older than 180 days can no longer be updated with new application associations. Stream groups expire when they are 365 days old, at which point they can no longer stream sessions. The exact expiration date is indicated by the date value in the `ExpiresAt` field.

        command: |-
            Creates an application resource in Amazon GameLift Streams, which specifies the application content you want to stream, such as a game build or other software, and configures the settings to run it.

            Before you create an application, upload your application content files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see **Getting Started** in the Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide.

            Make sure that your files in the Amazon S3 bucket are the correct version you want to use. If you change the files at a later time, you will need to create a new Amazon GameLift Streams application.

            If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins to create an application and sets the status to `INITIALIZED`. When an application reaches `READY` status, you can use the application to set up stream groups and start streams. To track application status, call [GetApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetApplication.html).
        flag:
            application-log-output-uri: |-
                An Amazon S3 URI to a bucket where you would like Amazon GameLift Streams to save application logs. Required if you specify one or more `ApplicationLogPaths`.

                The log bucket must have permissions that give Amazon GameLift Streams access to write the log files. For more information, see [Application log bucket permission policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/applications.html#application-bucket-permission-template) in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.
            application-log-paths: Locations of log files that your content generates during a stream session. Enter path values that are relative to the `ApplicationSourceUri` location. You can specify up to 10 log paths. Amazon GameLift Streams uploads designated log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify in `ApplicationLogOutputUri` at the end of a stream session. To retrieve stored log files, call [GetStreamSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamSession.html) and get the `LogFileLocationUri`.
            application-source-uri: |-
                The location of the content that you want to stream. Enter an Amazon S3 URI to a bucket that contains your game or other application. The location can have a multi-level prefix structure, but it must include all the files needed to run the content. Amazon GameLift Streams copies everything under the specified location.

                This value is immutable. To designate a different content location, create a new application.

                The Amazon S3 bucket and the Amazon GameLift Streams application must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

            executable-path: The relative path and file name of the executable file that Amazon GameLift Streams will stream. Specify a path relative to the location set in `ApplicationSourceUri`. The file must be contained within the application's root folder. For Windows applications, the file must be a valid Windows executable or batch file with a filename ending in .exe, .cmd, or .bat. For Linux applications, the file must be a valid Linux binary executable or a script that contains an initial interpreter line starting with a shebang ('`#!`').

            When you disassociate, or unlink, an application from a stream group, you can no longer stream this application by using that stream group's allocated compute resources. Any streams in process will continue until they terminate, which helps avoid interrupting an end-user's stream. Amazon GameLift Streams will not initiate new streams in the stream group using the disassociated application. The disassociate action does not affect the stream capacity of a stream group. To disassociate an application, the stream group must be in `ACTIVE` status.

            If you disassociate the default application, Amazon GameLift Streams will automatically choose a new default application from the remaining associated applications. To change which application is the default application, call [UpdateStreamGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html) and specify a new `DefaultApplicationIdentifier`.

However, this does not delete the original files that you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket; you can delete these any time after Amazon GameLift Streams creates an application, which is the only time Amazon GameLift Streams accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.

            You can only delete an application that meets the following conditions:

            - The application is in `READY` or `ERROR` status. You cannot delete an application that's in `PROCESSING` or `INITIALIZED` status.
            - The application is not the default application of any stream groups. You must first delete the stream group by using [DeleteStreamGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_DeleteStreamGroup.html).
            - The application is not linked to any stream groups. You must first unlink the stream group by using [DisassociateApplications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_DisassociateApplications.html).
            - An application is not streaming in any ongoing stream session. You must wait until the client ends the stream session or call [TerminateStreamSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TerminateStreamSession.html) to end the stream.

        command: "This action initiates a new stream session and outputs connection information that clients can use to access the stream. A stream session refers to an instance of a stream that Amazon GameLift Streams transmits from the server to the end-user. A stream session runs on a compute resource that a stream group has allocated. The start stream session process works as follows:\n\n1. Prerequisites:\n   \n   - You must have a stream group in `ACTIVE` status\n   - You must have idle or on-demand capacity in a stream group in the location you want to stream from\n   - You must have at least one application associated to the stream group (use [AssociateApplications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AssociateApplications.html) if needed)\n2. Start stream request:\n   \n   - Your backend server calls **StartStreamSession** to initiate connection\n   - Amazon GameLift Streams creates the stream session resource, assigns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value, and begins searching for available stream capacity to run the stream\n   - Session transitions to `ACTIVATING` status\n3. Placement completion:\n   \n   - If Amazon GameLift Streams is successful in finding capacity for the stream, the stream session status changes to `ACTIVE` status and **StartStreamSession** returns stream connection information\n   - If Amazon GameLift Streams was not successful in finding capacity within the placement timeout period (defined according to the capacity type and platform type), the stream session status changes to `ERROR` status and **StartStreamSession** returns a `StatusReason` of `placementTimeout`\n4. Connection completion:\n   \n   - Provide the new connection information to the requesting client\n   - Client must establish connection within `ConnectionTimeoutSeconds` (specified in **StartStreamSession** parameters)\n   - Session terminates automatically if client fails to connect in time\n\nFor more information about the stream session lifecycle, see [Stream sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/stream-sessions.html) in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.\n\nTimeouts to be aware of that affect a stream session:\n\n- **Placement timeout**: The amount of time that Amazon GameLift Streams has to find capacity for a stream request. Placement timeout varies based on the capacity type used to fulfill your stream request:\n  \n  - **Always-on capacity**: 75 seconds\n  - **On-demand capacity**:\n    \n    - Linux/Proton runtimes: 90 seconds\n    - Windows runtime: 10 minutes\n- **Connection timeout**: The amount of time that Amazon GameLift Streams waits for a client to connect to a stream session in `ACTIVE` status, or reconnect to a stream session in `PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION` status, the latter of which occurs when a client disconnects or loses connection from a stream session. If no client connects before the timeout, Amazon GameLift Streams terminates the stream session. This value is specified by `ConnectionTimeoutSeconds` in the `StartStreamSession` parameters.\n- **Idle timeout**: A stream session will be terminated if no user input has been received for 60 minutes.\n- **Maximum session length**: A stream session will be terminated after this amount of time has elapsed since it started, regardless of any existing client connections. This value is specified by `SessionLengthSeconds` in the `StartStreamSession` parameters.\n\nTo start a new stream session, specify a stream group ID and application ID, along with the transport protocol and signal request to use with the stream session.\n\nFor stream groups that have multiple locations, provide a set of locations ordered by priority using a `Locations` parameter. Amazon GameLift Streams will start a single stream session in the next available location. An application must be finished replicating to a remote location before the remote location can host a stream.\n\nTo reconnect to a stream session after a client disconnects or loses connection, use [CreateStreamSessionConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_CreateStreamSessionConnection.html)."

            client-token: A unique identifier that represents a client request. The request is idempotent, which ensures that an API request completes only once. When users send a request, Amazon GameLift Streams automatically populates this field.
            connection-timeout-seconds: Length of time (in seconds) that Amazon GameLift Streams should wait for a client to connect or reconnect to the stream session. Applies to both connection and reconnection scenarios. This time span starts when the stream session reaches `ACTIVE` state. If no client connects before the timeout, Amazon GameLift Streams terminates the stream session. Default value is 120.

                The stream group to run this stream session with.

                This value is an [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html) or ID that uniquely identifies the stream group resource. Example ARN: `arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:streamgroup/sg-1AB2C3De4`. Example ID: `sg-1AB2C3De4`.
            locations: |-
                A list of locations, in order of priority, where you want Amazon GameLift Streams to start a stream from. For example, `us-east-1`. Amazon GameLift Streams selects the location with the next available capacity to start a single stream session in. If this value is empty, Amazon GameLift Streams attempts to start a stream session in the primary location.

                For a complete list of locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to [Regions, quotas, and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html) in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.
            protocol: The data transport protocol to use for the stream session.
            session-length-seconds: The maximum duration of a session. Amazon GameLift Streams will automatically terminate a session after this amount of time has elapsed, regardless of any existing client connections. Default value is 43200 (12 hours).
            signal-request: |-
                A WebRTC ICE offer string to use when initializing a WebRTC connection. Typically, the offer is a very long JSON string. Provide the string as a text value in quotes.

                Amazon GameLift Streams also supports setting the field to "NO\_CLIENT\_CONNECTION". This will create a session without needing any browser request or Web SDK integration. The session starts up as usual and waits for a reconnection from a browser, which is accomplished using [CreateStreamSessionConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_CreateStreamSessionConnection.html).
            user-id: An opaque, unique identifier for an end-user, defined by the developer.
