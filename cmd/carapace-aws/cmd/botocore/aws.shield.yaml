            The operation returns data for the time range of midnight UTC, one year ago, to midnight UTC, today. For example, if the current time is `2020-10-26 15:39:32 PDT`, equal to `2020-10-26 22:39:32 UTC`, then the time range for the attack data returned is from `2019-10-26 00:00:00 UTC` to `2020-10-26 00:00:00 UTC`.

            The time range indicates the period covered by the attack statistics data items.

            Enable the Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation for the protected resource.

            This feature is available for Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers only.

            This causes Shield Advanced to create, verify, and apply WAF rules for DDoS attacks that it detects for the resource. Shield Advanced applies the rules in a Shield rule group inside the web ACL that you've associated with the resource. For information about how automatic mitigation works and the requirements for using it, see [Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-automatic-app-layer-response.html).

            Don't use this action to make changes to automatic mitigation settings when it's already enabled for a resource. Instead, use [UpdateApplicationLayerAutomaticResponse]().

            To use this feature, you must associate a web ACL with the protected resource. The web ACL must be created using the latest version of WAF (v2). You can associate the web ACL through the Shield Advanced console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/). For more information, see [Getting Started with Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ddos.html). You can also associate the web ACL to the resource through the WAF console or the WAF API, but you must manage Shield Advanced automatic mitigation through Shield Advanced. For information about WAF, see [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
        flag:
            action: Specifies the action setting that Shield Advanced should use in the WAF rules that it creates on behalf of the protected resource in response to DDoS attacks. You specify this as part of the configuration for the automatic application layer DDoS mitigation feature, when you enable or update automatic mitigation. Shield Advanced creates the WAF rules in a Shield Advanced-managed rule group, inside the web ACL that you have associated with the resource.

You can retrieve a single protection by providing its name or the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of its protected resource. You can also retrieve all protections for a specific resource type. You can provide up to one criteria per filter type. Shield Advanced returns protections that exactly match all of the filter criteria that you provide.

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            You can associate only one `RoleArn` with your subscription. If you submit an `AssociateDRTRole` request for an account that already has an associated role, the new `RoleArn` will replace the existing `RoleArn`.

            Prior to making the `AssociateDRTRole` request, you must attach the `AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy` managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy). For more information see [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html). The role must also trust the service principal `drt.shield.amazonaws.com`. For more information, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html).

            The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration and create and update WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you.

            You must have the `iam:PassRole` permission to make an `AssociateDRTRole` request. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html).

                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The greatest number of objects that you want Shield Advanced to return to the list request. Shield Advanced might return fewer objects than you indicate in this setting, even if more objects are available. If there are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will always also return a `NextToken` value in the response.

                The default setting is 20.
            next-token: |-
                When you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the response does not include all of the remaining available objects, Shield Advanced includes a `NextToken` value in the response. You can retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again and providing the token that was returned by the prior call in your request.

                You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield Advanced to return for a single call with the `MaxResults` setting. Shield Advanced will not return more than `MaxResults` objects, but may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

                Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has not yet returned to you, the response will include a `NextToken` value.

                On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-arns: The ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) of the resources that were attacked. If you leave this blank, all applicable resources for this account will be included.
            start-time: The start of the time period for the attacks. This is a `timestamp` type. The request syntax listing for this call indicates a `number` type, but you can provide the time in any valid [timestamp format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp) setting.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
