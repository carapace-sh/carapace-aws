            Associates the specified subnets in the Amazon VPC to the firewall. You can specify one subnet for each of the Availability Zones that the VPC spans.

            This request creates an Network Firewall firewall endpoint in each of the subnets. To enable the firewall's protections, you must also modify the VPC's route tables for each subnet's Availability Zone, to redirect the traffic that's coming into and going out of the zone through the firewall endpoint.

                To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an `InvalidTokenException`. If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates an Network Firewall TLS inspection configuration. Network Firewall uses TLS inspection configurations to decrypt your firewall's inbound and outbound SSL/TLS traffic. After decryption, Network Firewall inspects the traffic according to your firewall policy's stateful rules, and then re-encrypts it before sending it to its destination. You can enable inspection of your firewall's inbound traffic, outbound traffic, or both. To use TLS inspection with your firewall, you must first import or provision certificates using ACM, create a TLS inspection configuration, add that configuration to a new firewall policy, and then associate that policy with your firewall.

            To update the settings for a TLS inspection configuration, use [UpdateTLSInspectionConfiguration]().

            To manage a TLS inspection configuration's tags, use the standard Amazon Web Services resource tagging operations, [ListTagsForResource](), [TagResource](), and [UntagResource]().

            To retrieve information about TLS inspection configurations, use [ListTLSInspectionConfigurations]() and [DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration]().

            For more information about TLS inspection configurations, see [Inspecting SSL/TLS traffic with TLS inspection configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/tls-inspection.html) in the *Network Firewall Developer Guide*.

                Network Firewall uses a TLS inspection configuration to decrypt traffic. Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending it to its destination.

                To use a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a new Network Firewall firewall policy, then you apply the firewall policy to a firewall. Network Firewall acts as a proxy service to decrypt and inspect the traffic traveling through your firewalls. You can reference a TLS inspection configuration from more than one firewall policy, and you can use a firewall policy in more than one firewall.

            You can check whether a firewall is in use by reviewing the route tables for the Availability Zones where you have firewall subnet mappings. Retrieve the subnet mappings by calling [DescribeFirewall](). You define and update the route tables through Amazon VPC. As needed, update the route tables for the zones to remove the firewall endpoints. When the route tables no longer use the firewall endpoints, you can remove the firewall safely.

            max-results: The maximum number of objects that you want Network Firewall to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Network Firewall provides a `NextToken` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.
            next-token: When you request a list of objects with a `MaxResults` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a `NextToken` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

            You can check whether an endpoint association is in use by reviewing the route tables for the Availability Zones where you have the endpoint subnet mapping. You can retrieve the subnet mapping by calling [DescribeVpcEndpointAssociation](). You define and update the route tables through Amazon VPC. As needed, update the route tables for the Availability Zone to remove the firewall endpoint for the association. When the route tables no longer use the firewall endpoint, you can remove the endpoint association safely.

                Network Firewall uses a TLS inspection configuration to decrypt traffic. Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending it to its destination.

                To use a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a new Network Firewall firewall policy, then you apply the firewall policy to a firewall. Network Firewall acts as a proxy service to decrypt and inspect the traffic traveling through your firewalls. You can reference a TLS inspection configuration from more than one firewall policy, and you can use a firewall policy in more than one firewall.

                An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.

                To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.

                To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an `InvalidTokenException`. If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.

            Accepts a transit gateway attachment request for Network Firewall. When you accept the attachment request, Network Firewall creates the necessary routing components to enable traffic flow between the transit gateway and firewall endpoints.

            You must accept a transit gateway attachment to complete the creation of a transit gateway-attached firewall, unless auto-accept is enabled on the transit gateway. After acceptance, use [DescribeFirewall]() to verify the firewall status.

            To reject an attachment instead of accepting it, use [RejectNetworkFirewallTransitGatewayAttachment]().

            It can take several minutes for the attachment acceptance to complete and the firewall to become available.

            To avoid encountering operation limits, you should avoid starting captures with broad filters, like wide IP ranges. Instead, we recommend you define more specific criteria with `FlowFilters`, like narrow IP ranges, ports, or protocols.

You must change the logging configuration one [LogDestinationConfig]() at a time inside the retrieved [LoggingConfiguration]() object.

            You can perform only one of the following actions in any call to `UpdateLoggingConfiguration`:

            - Create a new log destination object by adding a single `LogDestinationConfig` array element to `LogDestinationConfigs`.
            - Delete a log destination object by removing a single `LogDestinationConfig` array element from `LogDestinationConfigs`.
            - Change the `LogDestination` setting in a single `LogDestinationConfig` array element.

            You can't change the `LogDestinationType` or `LogType` in a `LogDestinationConfig`. To change these settings, delete the existing `LogDestinationConfig` object and create a new one, using two separate calls to this update operation.

                An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.

                To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it.

                To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an `InvalidTokenException`. If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.

If set to `TRUE`, Network Firewall runs the analysis and then creates the rule group for you. To run the stateless rule group analyzer without creating the rule group, set `DryRun` to `TRUE`.
            capacity: |-
                The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group.

                You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling [CreateRuleGroup]() with `DryRun` set to `TRUE`.

                You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave room for your rule group to grow.

                **Capacity for a stateless rule group**

                For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.

                To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the capacity requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:

                - A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.
                - A match setting with `Any` specified has a value of 1.
                - All other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements provided in the setting. For example, a protocol setting \["UDP"] and a source setting \["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting \["UDP","TCP"] has a value of 2. A source setting \["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of 3.

                A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting \["UDP","TCP"], source setting \["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification or no specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement of 6.

                **Capacity for a stateful rule group**

                For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.

In the resource policy, you specify the accounts that you want to share the Network Firewall resource with and the operations that you want the accounts to be able to perform.

            When you add an account in the resource policy, you then run the following Resource Access Manager (RAM) operations to access and accept the shared resource.

            - [GetResourceShareInvitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceShareInvitations.html) - Returns the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resource share invitations.

            Creates an Network Firewall [Firewall]() and accompanying [FirewallStatus]() for a VPC.

            The firewall defines the configuration settings for an Network Firewall firewall. The settings that you can define at creation include the firewall policy, the subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints, and any tags that are attached to the firewall Amazon Web Services resource.

            After you create a firewall, you can provide additional settings, like the logging configuration.

            To update the settings for a firewall, you use the operations that apply to the settings themselves, for example [UpdateLoggingConfiguration](), [AssociateSubnets](), and [UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection]().

            To manage a firewall's tags, use the standard Amazon Web Services resource tagging operations, [ListTagsForResource](), [TagResource](), and [UntagResource]().

            To retrieve information about firewalls, use [ListFirewalls]() and [DescribeFirewall]().

            To generate a report on the last 30 days of traffic monitored by a firewall, use [StartAnalysisReport]().

            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            dry-run: |-
                Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the request, rather than run the request.

                If set to `TRUE`, Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to `FALSE`, but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid.

                If set to `FALSE`, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.
            encryption-configuration: A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your firewall policy resources.
            firewall-policy: The updated firewall policy to use for the firewall. You can't add or remove a [TLSInspectionConfiguration]() after you create a firewall policy. However, you can replace an existing TLS inspection configuration with another `TLSInspectionConfiguration`.
            firewall-policy-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

                You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
            firewall-policy-name: |-
                The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can't change the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

                You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            update-token: |-
                A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall policy. The token marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request.

                To make changes to the policy, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an `InvalidTokenException`. If this happens, retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current copy of it with current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.
