                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results the response can return. If your request would return more than the maximum the response will return a `nextToken` value, use this value when you call the action again to get the remaining results.
            next-token: A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response. Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request to a list action. If your response returns more than the `maxResults` maximum value it will also return a `nextToken` value. For subsequent calls, use the `nextToken` value returned from the previous request to continue listing results after the first page.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            max-results: The maximum number of results the response can return. If your request would return more than the maximum the response will return a `nextToken` value, use this value when you call the action again to get the remaining results.
            next-token: A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response. Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request to a list action. If your response returns more than the `maxResults` maximum value it will also return a `nextToken` value. For subsequent calls, use the `nextToken` value returned from the previous request to continue listing results after the first page.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            max-results: The maximum number of results the response can return. If your request would return more than the maximum the response will return a `nextToken` value, use this value when you call the action again to get the remaining results.
            next-token: A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response. Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request to a list action. If your response returns more than the `maxResults` maximum value it will also return a `nextToken` value. For subsequent calls, use the NextToken value returned from the previous request to continue listing results after the first page.
