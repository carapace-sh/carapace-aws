                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
