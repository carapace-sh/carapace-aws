            Assigns access to a principal for a specified Amazon Web Services account using a specified permission set.

            The term *principal* here refers to a user or group that is defined in IAM Identity Center.

            As part of a successful `CreateAccountAssignment` call, the specified permission set will automatically be provisioned to the account in the form of an IAM policy. That policy is attached to the IAM role created in IAM Identity Center. If the permission set is subsequently updated, the corresponding IAM policies attached to roles in your accounts will not be updated automatically. In this case, you must call `ProvisionPermissionSet` to make these updates.

            After a successful response, call `DescribeAccountAssignmentCreationStatus` to describe the status of an assignment creation request.

For more information on the IAM Identity Center supported grant workflows, see [SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/customermanagedapps-saml2-oauth2.html).\n\nA grant is created between your applications and Identity Center instance which enables an application to use specified mechanisms to obtain tokens. These tokens are used by your applications to gain access to Amazon Web Services resources on behalf of users. The following elements are within these exchanges:\n\n- **Requester** - The application requesting access to Amazon Web Services resources.\n- **Subject** - Typically the user that is requesting access to Amazon Web Services resources.\n- **Grant** - Conceptually, a grant is authorization to access Amazon Web Services resources. These grants authorize token generation for authenticating access to the requester and for the request to make requests on behalf of the subjects. There are four types of grants:\n  \n  - **AuthorizationCode** - Allows an application to request authorization through a series of user-agent redirects.\n  - **JWT bearer** - Authorizes an application to exchange a JSON Web Token that came from an external identity provider. To learn more, see [RFC 6479](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).\n  - **Refresh token** - Enables application to request new access tokens to replace expiring or expired access tokens.\n  - **Exchange token** - A grant that requests tokens from the authorization server by providing a ‘subject’ token with access scope authorizing trusted identity propagation to this application. To learn more, see [RFC 8693](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693).\n- **Authorization server** - IAM Identity Center requests tokens.\n\nUser credentials are never shared directly within these exchanges. Instead, applications use grants to request access tokens from IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [RFC 6479](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).\n\n**Use cases**\n\n- Connecting to custom applications.\n- Configuring an Amazon Web Services service to make calls to another Amazon Web Services services using JWT tokens."

Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

                If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

            Creates an instance of IAM Identity Center for a standalone Amazon Web Services account that is not managed by Organizations or a member Amazon Web Services account in an organization. You can create only one instance per account and across all Amazon Web Services Regions.

            The CreateInstance request is rejected if the following apply:

            - The instance is created within the organization management account.
            - An instance already exists in the same account.

            client-token: |-
                Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

                If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

                If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

        IAM Identity Center is the Amazon Web Services solution for connecting your workforce users to Amazon Web Services managed applications and other Amazon Web Services resources. You can connect your existing identity provider and synchronize users and groups from your directory, or create and manage your users directly in IAM Identity Center. You can then use IAM Identity Center for either or both of the following:

        - User access to applications
        - User access to Amazon Web Services accounts

        This guide provides information about single sign-on operations that you can use for access to applications and Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see the [IAM Identity Center User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

        IAM Identity Center uses the `sso` and `identitystore` API namespaces.

        Many API operations for IAM Identity Center rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the [Identity Store API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html).

        Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
