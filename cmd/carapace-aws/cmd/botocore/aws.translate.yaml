                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            Stops an asynchronous batch translation job that is in progress.

            If the job's state is `IN_PROGRESS`, the job will be marked for termination and put into the `STOP_REQUESTED` state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the `COMPLETED` state. Otherwise, the job is put into the `STOPPED` state.

            Asynchronous batch translation jobs are started with the [StartTextTranslationJob]() operation. You can use the [DescribeTextTranslationJob]() or [ListTextTranslationJobs]() operations to get a batch translation job's `JobId`.
