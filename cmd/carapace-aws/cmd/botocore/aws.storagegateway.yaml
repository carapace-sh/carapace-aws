            Configures one or more gateway local disks as working storage for a gateway. This operation is only supported in the stored volume gateway type. This operation is deprecated in cached volume API version 20120630. Use [AddUploadBuffer]() instead.

            Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You can also use the [AddUploadBuffer]() operation to add upload buffer to a stored volume gateway.

            In the request, you specify the gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to which you want to add working storage, and one or more disk IDs that you want to configure as working storage.

            Deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The operation deletes the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway virtual machine (VM) from your host computer.

            After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed snapshots of the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the gateway, however, pending snapshots will not complete. After you delete a gateway, your next step is to remove it from your environment.

            You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted; however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will continue to be billed for these snapshots. You can choose to remove all remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription.  If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console.

            Refreshes the cached inventory of objects for the specified file share. This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that were added, removed, or replaced since the gateway last listed the bucket's contents and cached the results. This operation does not import files into the S3 File Gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached inventory to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in the S3 bucket. This operation is only supported in the S3 File Gateway types.

            You can subscribe to be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event when your `RefreshCache` operation completes. For more information, see [Getting notified about file operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification) in the *Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide*. This operation is Only supported for S3 File Gateways.

            When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation. When the API call completes and returns a success code, it doesn't necessarily mean that the file refresh has completed. You should use the refresh-complete notification to determine that the operation has completed before you check for new files on the gateway file share. You can subscribe to be notified through a CloudWatch event when your `RefreshCache` operation completes.

            Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no more than two refreshes at any time. We recommend using the refresh-complete CloudWatch event notification before issuing additional requests. For more information, see [Getting notified about file operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification) in the *Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide*.

            - Wait at least 60 seconds between consecutive RefreshCache API requests.
            - If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests are already being processed, any new request will cause an `InvalidGatewayRequestException` error because too many requests were sent to the server.

            The S3 bucket name does not need to be included when entering the list of folders in the FolderList parameter.

            Resets all cache disks that have encountered an error and makes the disks available for reconfiguration as cache storage. If your cache disk encounters an error, the gateway prevents read and write operations on virtual tapes in the gateway. For example, an error can occur when a disk is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the gateway loses its cache storage. At this point, you can reconfigure the disks as cache disks. This operation is only supported in the cached volume and tape types.

            If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost. After you reset cache disks, there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway, so you must configure at least one new cache disk for your gateway to function properly.

        command: |-
            Creates a volume on a specified gateway. This operation is only supported in the stored volume gateway type.

            The size of the volume to create is inferred from the disk size. You can choose to preserve existing data on the disk, create volume from an existing snapshot, or create an empty volume. If you choose to create an empty gateway volume, then any existing data on the disk is erased.

            In the request, you must specify the gateway and the disk information on which you are creating the volume. In response, the gateway creates the volume and returns volume information such as the volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN), its size, and the iSCSI target ARN that initiators can use to connect to the volume target.

            Initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume recovery point. This operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type.

            A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get a list of volume recovery point for cached volume gateway, use [ListVolumeRecoveryPoints]().

            In the `CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint` request, you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide a description for the snapshot. When the gateway takes a snapshot of the specified volume, the snapshot and its description appear in the Storage Gateway console. In response, the gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot.

            To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, see [DescribeSnapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSnapshots.html) or [DeleteSnapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteSnapshot.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference*.

        command: |-
            Creates a Server Message Block (SMB) file share on an existing S3 File Gateway. In Storage Gateway, a file share is a file system mount point backed by Amazon S3 cloud storage. Storage Gateway exposes file shares using an SMB interface. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

            S3 File Gateways require Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure that Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services Region you are creating your S3 File Gateway in. If Amazon Web Services STS is not activated in this Amazon Web Services Region, activate it. For information about how to activate Amazon Web Services STS, see [Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

            File gateways don't support creating hard or symbolic links on a file share.

                Use this option very carefully, because any user in this list can do anything they like on the file share, regardless of file permissions.
            audit-destination-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.
            authentication: |-
                The authentication method that users use to access the file share. The default is `ActiveDirectory`.

                Valid Values: `ActiveDirectory` | `GuestAccess`
            bucket-region: |-
                Specifies the Region of the S3 bucket where the SMB file share stores files.

                This parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.
            cache-attributes: Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.
            case-sensitivity: The case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For `ClientSpecified`, the client determines the case sensitivity. For `CaseSensitive`, the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is `ClientSpecified`.

            default-storage-class: |-
                The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is `S3_STANDARD`. Optional.

                Valid Values: `S3_STANDARD` | `S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING` | `S3_STANDARD_IA` | `S3_ONEZONE_IA`
            encryption-type: |-
                A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.
            file-share-name: |-
                The name of the file share. Optional.

                `FileShareName` must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in `LocationARN`, or if an access point or access point alias is used.

                A valid SMB file share name cannot contain the following characters: `[`,`]`,`#`,`;`,`<`,`>`,`:`,`"`,`\`,`/`,`|`,`?`,`*`,`+`, or ASCII control characters `1-31`.
            gateway-arn: The ARN of the S3 File Gateway on which you want to create a file share.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            guess-mime-type-enabled: |-
                A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to `true` to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to `false`. The default value is `true`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            invalid-user-list: 'A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: `DOMAIN\User1`, `user1`, `@group1`, and `@DOMAIN\group1`. Can only be set if Authentication is set to `ActiveDirectory`.'
            kms-encrypted: |-
                Optional. Set to `true` to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or `false` to use a key managed by Amazon S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS), set the `EncryptionType` parameter instead.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            kms-key: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if `KMSEncrypted` is `true`, or if `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`.
            location-arn: |-
                A custom ARN for the backend storage used for storing data for file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional prefix concatenation. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point ARN or access point alias, as shown in the following examples.

                Bucket ARN:

                `arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/`

                Access point ARN:

                `arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/access-point-name/prefix/`

                If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be configured to delegate access control to the access point. For information, see [Delegating access control to access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-policies.html#access-points-delegating-control) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Access point alias:

                `test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias`
            notification-policy: |-
                The notification policy of the file share. `SettlingTimeInSeconds` controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an `ObjectUploaded` notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

                `SettlingTimeInSeconds` has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

                This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` on with `SettlingTimeInSeconds` set to 60.

                `{\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}`

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` off.

                `{}`
            object-acl: A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is `private`.
            oplocks-enabled: |-
                Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.

                Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            read-only: |-
                A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to `true` to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to `false`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            requester-pays: |-
                A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to `true`, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                `RequesterPays` is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            role: The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that an S3 File Gateway assumes when it accesses the underlying storage.
            smbacl-enabled: |-
                Set this value to `true` to enable access control list (ACL) on the SMB file share. Set it to `false` to map file and directory permissions to the POSIX permissions.

                For more information, see [Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/smb-acl.html) in the *Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide*.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            tags: |-
                A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the NFS file share. Each tag is a key-value pair.

                Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is 256.
            valid-user-list: 'A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed to access the file [share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: `DOMAIN\User1`, `user1`, `@group1`, and `@DOMAIN\group1`. Can only be set if Authentication is set to `ActiveDirectory`.]()'
            vpc-endpoint-dns-name: |-
                Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file share uses to connect to Amazon S3.

                This parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Adds a file gateway to an Active Directory domain. This operation is only supported for file gateways that support the SMB file protocol.

            Joining a domain creates an Active Directory computer account in the default organizational unit, using the gateway's **Gateway ID** as the account name (for example, SGW-1234ADE). If your Active Directory environment requires that you pre-stage accounts to facilitate the join domain process, you will need to create this account ahead of time.

            To create the gateway's computer account in an organizational unit other than the default, you must specify the organizational unit when joining the domain.

            Initiates a snapshot of a volume.

            Storage Gateway provides the ability to back up point-in-time snapshots of your data to Amazon Simple Storage (Amazon S3) for durable off-site recovery, and also import the data to an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). You can take snapshots of your gateway volume on a scheduled or ad hoc basis. This API enables you to take an ad hoc snapshot. For more information, see [Editing a snapshot schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-volumes.html#SchedulingSnapshot).

            In the `CreateSnapshot` request, you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide description for the snapshot. When Storage Gateway takes the snapshot of specified volume, the snapshot and description appears in the Storage Gateway console. In response, Storage Gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot. This operation is only supported in stored and cached volume gateway type.

            To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, see [DescribeSnapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSnapshots.html) or [DeleteSnapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteSnapshot.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference*.

            Volume and snapshot IDs are changing to a longer length ID format. For more information, see the important note on the [Welcome](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) page.

By default, gateways do not have bandwidth rate limit schedules, which means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. This operation is supported only for volume, tape and S3 file gateways. FSx file gateways do not support bandwidth rate limits.

            This operation returns information about a gateway's bandwidth rate limit schedule. A bandwidth rate limit schedule consists of one or more bandwidth rate limit intervals. A bandwidth rate limit interval defines a period of time on one or more days of the week, during which bandwidth rate limits are specified for uploading, downloading, or both.

            A bandwidth rate limit interval consists of one or more days of the week, a start hour and minute, an ending hour and minute, and bandwidth rate limits for uploading and downloading

            If no bandwidth rate limit schedule intervals are set for the gateway, this operation returns an empty response. To specify which gateway to describe, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.

                The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is `S3_STANDARD`. Optional.

                Valid Values: `S3_STANDARD` | `S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING` | `S3_STANDARD_IA` | `S3_ONEZONE_IA`
            encryption-type: |-
                A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.
            file-share-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share to be updated.
            file-share-name: |-
                The name of the file share. Optional.

                `FileShareName` must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in `LocationARN`, or if an access point or access point alias is used.

                A valid NFS file share name can only contain the following characters: `a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `-`, `.`, and `_`.

                A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to `true` to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to `false`. The default value is `true`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            kms-encrypted: |-
                Optional. Set to `true` to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or `false` to use a key managed by Amazon S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS), set the `EncryptionType` parameter instead.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            kms-key: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if `KMSEncrypted` is `true`, or if `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`.
            nfs-file-share-defaults: The default values for the file share. Optional.
            notification-policy: |-
                The notification policy of the file share. `SettlingTimeInSeconds` controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an `ObjectUploaded` notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

                `SettlingTimeInSeconds` has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

                This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` on with `SettlingTimeInSeconds` set to 60.

                `{\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}`

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` off.

                `{}`
            object-acl: A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is `private`.
            read-only: |-
                A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to `true` to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to `false`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            requester-pays: |-
                A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to `true`, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                `RequesterPays` is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            squash: |-
                The user mapped to anonymous user.

                Valid values are the following:

                - `RootSquash`: Only root is mapped to anonymous user.
                - `NoSquash`: No one is mapped to anonymous user.

            Sends you notification through Amazon EventBridge when all files written to your file share have been uploaded to Amazon S3.

            Storage Gateway can send a notification through Amazon EventBridge when all files written to your file share up to that point in time have been uploaded to Amazon S3. These files include files written to the file share up to the time that you make a request for notification. When the upload is done, Storage Gateway sends you notification through EventBridge. You can configure EventBridge to send the notification through event targets such as Amazon SNS or Lambda function. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

            For more information, see [Getting file upload notification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification) in the *Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide*.

            Shuts down a Tape Gateway or Volume Gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.

            This API action cannot be used to shut down S3 File Gateway or FSx File Gateway.

            The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.

            If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.

            After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except [StartGateway](), [DescribeGatewayInformation](), and [ListGateways](). For more information, see [ActivateGateway](). Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.

            When you make a shutdown request, you will get a `200 OK` success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to shut down. You can call the [DescribeGatewayInformation]() API to check the status. For more information, see [ActivateGateway]().

            If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using [DeleteGateway]()) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.

                Optional. Set to `true` to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or `false` to use a key managed by Amazon S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS), set the `EncryptionType` parameter instead.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.

            kms-key: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if `KMSEncrypted` is `true`, or if `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`.
            notification-policy: |-
                The notification policy of the file share. `SettlingTimeInSeconds` controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an `ObjectUploaded` notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

                `SettlingTimeInSeconds` has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

                This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` on with `SettlingTimeInSeconds` set to 60.

                `{\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}`

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` off.

                Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.

                Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            read-only: |-
                A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to `true` to set write status to read-only, otherwise set to `false`.

            requester-pays: |-
                A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to `true`, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                `RequesterPays` is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            smbacl-enabled: |-
                Set this value to `true` to enable access control list (ACL) on the SMB file share. Set it to `false` to map file and directory permissions to the POSIX permissions.

        command: |-
            Creates a Network File System (NFS) file share on an existing S3 File Gateway. In Storage Gateway, a file share is a file system mount point backed by Amazon S3 cloud storage. Storage Gateway exposes file shares using an NFS interface. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

            S3 File gateway requires Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services Region you are creating your S3 File Gateway in. If Amazon Web Services STS is not activated in the Amazon Web Services Region, activate it. For information about how to activate Amazon Web Services STS, see [Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

            S3 File Gateways do not support creating hard or symbolic links on a file share.

            client-list: The list of clients that are allowed to access the S3 File Gateway. The list must contain either valid IPv4/IPv6 addresses or valid CIDR blocks.
            client-token: A unique string value that you supply that is used by S3 File Gateway to ensure idempotent file share creation.
            default-storage-class: |-
                The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is `S3_STANDARD`. Optional.

                Valid Values: `S3_STANDARD` | `S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING` | `S3_STANDARD_IA` | `S3_ONEZONE_IA`
            encryption-type: |-
                A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.
            file-share-name: |-
                The name of the file share. Optional.

                `FileShareName` must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in `LocationARN`, or if an access point or access point alias is used.

                A valid NFS file share name can only contain the following characters: `a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `-`, `.`, and `_`.
            gateway-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 File Gateway on which you want to create a file share.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            guess-mime-type-enabled: |-
                A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to `true` to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to `false`. The default value is `true`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            kms-encrypted: |-
                Optional. Set to `true` to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or `false` to use a key managed by Amazon S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS), set the `EncryptionType` parameter instead.

                We recommend using `EncryptionType` instead of `KMSEncrypted` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

                If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if `EncryptionType` is `SseS3`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `false`. If `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`, then `KMSEncrypted` must be `true`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            kms-key: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if `KMSEncrypted` is `true`, or if `EncryptionType` is `SseKms` or `DsseKms`.
            location-arn: |-
                A custom ARN for the backend storage used for storing data for file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional prefix concatenation. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point ARN or access point alias, as shown in the following examples.

                Bucket ARN:

                `arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/`

                Access point ARN:

                `arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/access-point-name/prefix/`

                If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be configured to delegate access control to the access point. For information, see [Delegating access control to access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-policies.html#access-points-delegating-control) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                Access point alias:

                `test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias`
            nfs-file-share-defaults: File share default values. Optional.
            notification-policy: |-
                The notification policy of the file share. `SettlingTimeInSeconds` controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an `ObjectUploaded` notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

                `SettlingTimeInSeconds` has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

                This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` on with `SettlingTimeInSeconds` set to 60.

                `{\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}`

                The following example sets `NotificationPolicy` off.

                `{}`
            object-acl: A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is `private`.
            read-only: |-
                A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to `true` to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to `false`.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            requester-pays: |-
                A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to `true`, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                `RequesterPays` is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

                Valid Values: `true` | `false`
            role: The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that an S3 File Gateway assumes when it accesses the underlying storage.
            squash: |-
                A value that maps a user to anonymous user.

                Valid values are the following:

                - `RootSquash`: Only root is mapped to anonymous user.
                - `NoSquash`: No one is mapped to anonymous user.
                - `AllSquash`: Everyone is mapped to anonymous user.
            tags: |-
                A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the NFS file share. Each tag is a key-value pair.

                Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is 256.
            vpc-endpoint-dns-name: |-
                Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the NFS file share uses to connect to Amazon S3.

                This parameter is required for NFS file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.
