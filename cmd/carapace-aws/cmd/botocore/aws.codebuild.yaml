                CODEBUILD

                Specifies that CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust CodeBuild's service principal.

                SERVICE\_ROLE

                Specifies that CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.

                When using a cross-account or private registry image, you must use `SERVICE_ROLE` credentials. When using an CodeBuild curated image, you must use `CODEBUILD` credentials.
            insecure-ssl-override: Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is specified in the batch build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the build's source is GitHub Enterprise.

            report-build-batch-status-override: |-
                Set to `true` to report to your source provider the status of a batch build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source provider other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an `invalidInputException` is thrown.

                The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider.
            secondary-artifacts-override: An array of `ProjectArtifacts` objects that override the secondary artifacts defined in the batch build project.
            secondary-sources-override: An array of `ProjectSource` objects that override the secondary sources defined in the batch build project.
            secondary-sources-version-override: An array of `ProjectSourceVersion` objects that override the secondary source versions in the batch build project.
            service-role-override: The name of a service role for this batch build that overrides the one specified in the batch build project.
            source-auth-override: A `SourceAuth` object that overrides the one defined in the batch build project. This override applies only if the build project's source is BitBucket or GitHub.
            source-location-override: A location that overrides, for this batch build, the source location defined in the batch build project.
            source-type-override: The source input type that overrides the source input defined in the batch build project.
            source-version: |-
                The version of the batch build input to be built, for this build only. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, the contents depends on the source provider:

                CodeCommit

                The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

                GitHub

                The commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format `pr/pull-request-ID` (for example `pr/25`). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                Bitbucket

                The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                Amazon S3

                The version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.

                If `sourceVersion` is specified at the project level, then this `sourceVersion` (at the build level) takes precedence.

                For more information, see [Source Version Sample with CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-source-version.html) in the *CodeBuild User Guide*.

The bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, `arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see [Buildspec File Name and Storage Location](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-name-storage).

                Since this property allows you to change the build commands that will run in the container, you should note that an IAM principal with the ability to call this API and set this parameter can override the default settings. Moreover, we encourage that you use a trustworthy buildspec location like a file in your source repository or a Amazon S3 bucket. Alternatively, you can restrict overrides to the buildspec by using a condition key: [Prevent unauthorized modifications to project buildspec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/action-context-keys.html#action-context-keys-example-overridebuildspec.html).

                CODEBUILD

                Specifies that CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust CodeBuild's service principal.

                SERVICE\_ROLE

                Specifies that CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.

                When using a cross-account or private registry image, you must use `SERVICE_ROLE` credentials. When using an CodeBuild curated image, you must use `CODEBUILD` credentials.
            insecure-ssl-override: Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is specified in the build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the build's source is GitHub Enterprise.

            report-build-status-override: |-
                Set to true to report to your source provider the status of a build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source provider other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket, an `invalidInputException` is thrown.

                To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see [Source provider access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html) in the *CodeBuild User Guide*.

                The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider.

            source-version: |-
                The version of the build input to be built, for this build only. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, the contents depends on the source provider:

                CodeCommit

                The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

                GitHub

                The commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format `pr/pull-request-ID` (for example `pr/25`). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                GitLab

                The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

                Bitbucket

                The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                Amazon S3

                The version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.

                If `sourceVersion` is specified at the project level, then this `sourceVersion` (at the build level) takes precedence.

                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of paginated test cases returned per response. Use `nextToken` to iterate pages in the list of returned `TestCase` objects. The default value is 100.
            next-token: During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned is the value specified in `maxResults`. If there more items in the list, then a unique string called a *nextToken* is returned. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return.
            next-token: The `nextToken` value returned from a previous call to `ListBuildBatches`. This specifies the next item to return. To return the beginning of the list, exclude this parameter.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-order: |-
                Specifies the sort order of the returned items. Valid values include:

                - `ASCENDING`: List the batch build identifiers in ascending order by identifier.
                - `DESCENDING`: List the batch build identifiers in descending order by identifier.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            If you enable webhooks for an CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in CodeBuild. In the CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 5 in [Change a Build Project's Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/change-project.html#change-project-console).

                It is recommended that you use `filterGroups` instead of `branchFilter`.

To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            delete-reports: |-
                If `true`, deletes any reports that belong to a report group before deleting the report group.

                If `false`, you must delete any reports in the report group. Use [ListReportsForReportGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_ListReportsForReportGroup.html) to get the reports in a report group. Use [DeleteReport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteReport.html) to delete the reports. If you call `DeleteReportGroup` for a report group that contains one or more reports, an exception is thrown.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of paginated reports returned per response. Use `nextToken` to iterate pages in the list of returned `Report` objects. The default value is 100.
            next-token: During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned is the value specified in `maxResults`. If there more items in the list, then a unique string called a *nextToken* is returned. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort-order: |-
                Specifies the sort order for the list of returned reports. Valid values are:

                - `ASCENDING`: return reports in chronological order based on their creation date.
                - `DESCENDING`: return reports in the reverse chronological order based on their creation date.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
