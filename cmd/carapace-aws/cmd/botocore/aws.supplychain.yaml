            Enables you to programmatically create an Amazon Web Services Supply Chain instance by applying KMS keys and relevant information associated with the API without using the Amazon Web Services console.

            This is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a CreateInstance request, Amazon Web Services Supply Chain immediately returns the instance resource, instance ID, and the initializing state while simultaneously creating all required Amazon Web Services resources for an instance creation. You can use GetInstance to check the status of the instance. If the instance results in an unhealthy state, you need to check the error message, delete the current instance, and recreate a new one based on the mitigation from the error message.

            Enables you to programmatically delete an Amazon Web Services Supply Chain instance by deleting the KMS keys and relevant information associated with the API without using the Amazon Web Services console.

            This is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a DeleteInstance request, Amazon Web Services Supply Chain immediately returns a response with the instance resource, delete state while cleaning up all Amazon Web Services resources created during the instance creation process. You can use the GetInstance action to check the instance status.

            max-results: The number to specify the max number of flow executions to fetch in this paginated request.
            next-token: The pagination token to fetch next page of flow executions.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

      flags:
        --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided.
        --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided.
        --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.
        --resource-arn=!: The Amazon Web Services Supply chain resource ARN that needs to be tagged.

        command: You can create tags during or after creating a resource such as instance, data flow, or dataset in AWS Supply chain. During the data ingestion process, you can add tags such as dev, test, or prod to data flows created during the data ingestion process in the AWS Supply Chain datasets. You can use these tags to identify a group of resources or a single resource used by the developer.

        AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems. Using AWS Supply Chain, you can connect and extract your inventory, supply, and demand related data from existing ERP or supply chain systems into a single data model.

        The AWS Supply Chain API supports configuration data import for Supply Planning.

        All AWS Supply chain API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies.
