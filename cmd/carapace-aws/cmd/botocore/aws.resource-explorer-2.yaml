        command: "Turns on Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation by creating an index. Resource Explorer begins discovering the resources in this Region and stores the details about the resources in the index so that they can be queried by using the [Search]() operation. You can create only one index in a Region.\n\nThis operation creates only a *local* index. To promote the local index in one Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon Web Services account, use the [UpdateIndexType]() operation. For more information, see [Turning on cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.\n\nFor more details about what happens when you turn on Resource Explorer in an Amazon Web Services Region, see [Turn on Resource Explorer to index your resources in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-service-activate.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.\n\nIf this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in which you've created an index for Resource Explorer, then this operation also [creates a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html) in your Amazon Web Services account that allows Resource Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the index.\n\n- **Action**: `resource-explorer-2:CreateIndex`\n  \n  **Resource**: The ARN of the index (as it will exist after the operation completes) in the Amazon Web Services Region and account in which you're trying to create the index. Use the wildcard character (`*`) at the end of the string to match the eventual UUID. For example, the following `Resource` element restricts the role or user to creating an index in only the `us-east-2` Region of the specified account.\n  \n  `\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:<account-id>:index/*\"`\n  \n  Alternatively, you can use `\"Resource\": \"*\"` to allow the role or user to create an index in any Region.\n- **Action**: `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`\n  \n  **Resource**: No specific resource (\\*).\n  \n  This permission is required only the first time you create an index to turn on Resource Explorer in the account. Resource Explorer uses this to create the [service-linked role needed to index the resources in your account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html). Resource Explorer uses the same service-linked role for all additional indexes you create afterwards."

If you don't explicitly specify a view, then Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call this operation. The results are the logical intersection of the results that match both the `QueryString` parameter supplied to this operation and the `SearchFilter` parameter attached to the view.

            For the complete syntax supported by the `QueryString` parameter, see [Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/APIReference/about-query-syntax.html).

                The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            filters: |-
                An array of strings that specify which resources are included in the results of queries made using this view. When you use this view in a [Search]() operation, the filter string is combined with the search's `QueryString` parameter using a logical `AND` operator.

                For information about the supported syntax, see [Search query reference for Resource Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.

                This query string in the context of this operation supports only [filter prefixes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-filters) with optional [operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-operators). It doesn't support free-form text. For example, the string `region:us* service:ec2 -tag:stage=prod` includes all Amazon EC2 resources in any Amazon Web Services Region that begins with the letters `us` and is *not* tagged with a key `Stage` that has the value `prod`.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: |-
                The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

                The `ListResources` operation does not generate a `NextToken` if you set `MaxResults` to 1000.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            view-arn: Specifies the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the view to use for the query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the operation automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation. If the Region either doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission to use the default view, then the operation fails with a 401 Unauthorized exception.

            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

                An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

        Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.

        Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer. Resource Explorer [creates and maintains an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index) in each Region, with the details of that Region's resources.

        You can [search across all of the indexed Regions in your account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html) by designating one of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for the account. When you [promote a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html), Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account.

        For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including how to enable and configure the service, see the [Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/).
