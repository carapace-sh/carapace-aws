            Updates the maintenance configuration of the Managed Service for Apache Flink application.

            You can invoke this operation on an application that is in one of the two following states: `READY` or `RUNNING`. If you invoke it when the application is in a state other than these two states, it throws a `ResourceInUseException`. The service makes use of the updated configuration the next time it schedules maintenance for the application. If you invoke this operation after the service schedules maintenance, the service will apply the configuration update the next time it schedules maintenance for the application. This means that you might not see the maintenance configuration update applied to the maintenance process that follows a successful invocation of this operation, but to the following maintenance process instead.

            To see the current maintenance configuration of your application, invoke the [DescribeApplication]() operation.

            For information about application maintenance, see [Managed Service for Apache Flink for Apache Flink Maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/maintenance.html).

            This operation is supported only for Managed Service for Apache Flink.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            next-token: If a previous command returned a pagination token, pass it into this value to retrieve the next set of results. For more information about pagination, see [Using the Amazon Command Line Interface's Pagination Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html).
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

You can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each output configuration maps an in-application stream and an external destination.

            You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze the errors.

            Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the [DescribeApplication]() operation to find the current application version.

            conditional-token: A value you use to implement strong concurrency for application updates. You must provide the `ApplicationVersionID` or the `ConditionalToken`. You get the application's current `ConditionalToken` using [DescribeApplication](). For better concurrency support, use the `ConditionalToken` parameter instead of `CurrentApplicationVersionId`.
            current-application-version-id: The version of the application to which you want to add the VPC configuration. You must provide the `CurrentApplicationVersionId` or the `ConditionalToken`. You can use the [DescribeApplication]() operation to get the current application version. If the version specified is not the current version, the `ConcurrentModificationException` is returned. For better concurrency support, use the `ConditionalToken` parameter instead of `CurrentApplicationVersionId`.

            Creates and returns a URL that you can use to connect to an application's extension.

            The IAM role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to access the extension. After the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request that attempts to connect to the extension.

            You control the amount of time that the URL will be valid using the `SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds` parameter. If you do not provide this parameter, the returned URL is valid for twelve hours.

            The URL that you get from a call to CreateApplicationPresignedUrl must be used within 3 minutes to be valid. If you first try to use the URL after the 3-minute limit expires, the service returns an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.
