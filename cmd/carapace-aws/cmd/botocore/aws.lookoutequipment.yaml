For example, if inference is set to run every ten minutes, the delay is set to five minutes and the time is 09:08. The inference scheduler will wake up at the configured interval (which, without a delay configured, would be 09:10) plus the additional five minute delay time (so 09:15) to check your Amazon S3 bucket. The delay provides a buffer for you to upload data at the same frequency, so that you don't have to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data.

            Creates a machine learning model for data inference.

            A machine-learning (ML) model is a mathematical model that finds patterns in your data. In Amazon Lookout for Equipment, the model learns the patterns of normal behavior and detects abnormal behavior that could be potential equipment failure (or maintenance events). The models are made by analyzing normal data and abnormalities in machine behavior that have already occurred.

            Your model is trained using a portion of the data from your dataset and uses that data to learn patterns of normal behavior and abnormal patterns that lead to equipment failure. Another portion of the data is used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

                The configuration is the `TargetSamplingRate`, which is the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the `TargetSamplingRate` is 1 minute.

                When providing a value for the `TargetSamplingRate`, you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore *PT1S*, the value for a 15 minute rate is *PT15M*, and the value for a 1 hour rate is *PT1H*

For example, if five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler will wake up at the configured frequency with the additional five minute delay time to check the customer S3 bucket. The customer can upload data at the same frequency and they don't need to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data.

For instance, if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment will upload the real-time data to the source bucket once every 5 minutes. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout for Equipment starts a scheduled inference on your data. In this example, it starts once every 5 minutes.
