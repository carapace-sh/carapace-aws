            You can call `DescribeStream` at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.

            Each shard in the stream has a `SequenceNumberRange` associated with it. If the `SequenceNumberRange` has a `StartingSequenceNumber` but no `EndingSequenceNumber`, then the shard is still open (able to receive more stream records). If both `StartingSequenceNumber` and `EndingSequenceNumber` are present, then that shard is closed and can no longer receive more data.

            Retrieves the stream records from a given shard.

            Specify a shard iterator using the `ShardIterator` parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading stream records sequentially. If there are no stream records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, `GetRecords` returns an empty list. Note that it might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains stream records.

            `GetRecords` can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data or 1000 stream records, whichever comes first.

                - `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` - Start reading right after the position denoted by a specific sequence number.
                - `TRIM_HORIZON` - Start reading at the last (untrimmed) stream record, which is the oldest record in the shard. In DynamoDB Streams, there is a 24 hour limit on data retention. Stream records whose age exceeds this limit are subject to removal (trimming) from the stream.
                - `LATEST` - Start reading just after the most recent stream record in the shard, so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.
            stream-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream.
