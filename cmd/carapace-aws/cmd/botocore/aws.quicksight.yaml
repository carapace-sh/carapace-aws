            Deleting your Quick Sight account subscription has permanent, irreversible consequences across all Amazon Web Services regions:

            - Global deletion – Running this operation from any single region will delete your Quick Sight account and all data in every Amazon Web Services region where you have Quick Sight resources.
            - Complete data loss – All dashboards, analyses, datasets, data sources, and custom visuals will be permanently deleted across all regions.
            - Embedded content failure – All embedded dashboards and visuals in your applications will immediately stop working and display errors to end users.
            - Shared resources removed – All shared dashboards, folders, and resources will become inaccessible to other users and external recipients.
            - User access terminated – All Quick Sight users in your account will lose access immediately, including authors, readers, and administrators.
            - **No recovery possible** – Once deleted, your Quick Sight account and all associated data cannot be restored.

            Consider exporting critical dashboards and data before proceeding with account deletion.

            Use the `DeleteAccountSubscription` operation to delete an Quick Sight account. This operation will result in an error message if you have configured your account termination protection settings to `True`. To change this setting and delete your account, call the `UpdateAccountSettings` API and set the value of the `TerminationProtectionEnabled` parameter to `False`, then make another call to the `DeleteAccountSubscription` API.

This parameter should only be used when `ExternalLoginFederationProviderType` parameter is set to `CUSTOM_OIDC`.
            custom-permissions-name: |-
                (Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions allows you to control a user's access by restricting access the following operations:

                - Create and update data sources
                - Create and update datasets
                - Create and update email reports
                - Subscribe to email reports

                To add custom permissions to an existing user, use `UpdateUser` instead.

                A set of custom permissions includes any combination of these restrictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for custom permission sets by using the Quick Sight console. Then, you use the `RegisterUser` API operation to assign the named set of permissions to a Quick Sight user.

                Quick Sight custom permissions are applied through IAM policies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by assigning Quick Sight users to one of the default security cohorts in Quick Sight (admin, author, reader, admin pro, author pro, reader pro).

                This feature is available only to Quick Sight Enterprise edition subscriptions.

                The type of supported external login provider that provides identity to let a user federate into Amazon Quick Sight with an associated Identity and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported external login provider can be one of the following.

                - `COGNITO`: Amazon Cognito. The provider URL is cognito-identity.amazonaws.com. When choosing the `COGNITO` provider type, don’t use the "CustomFederationProviderUrl" parameter which is only needed when the external provider is custom.
                - `CUSTOM_OIDC`: Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing `CUSTOM_OIDC` type, use the `CustomFederationProviderUrl` parameter to provide the custom OIDC provider URL.

            Starts an asynchronous job that generates a snapshot of a dashboard's output. You can request one or several of the following format configurations in each API call.

            - 1 Paginated PDF
            - 1 Excel workbook that includes up to 5 table or pivot table visuals
            - 5 CSVs from table or pivot table visuals

            The status of a submitted job can be polled with the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob` API. When you call the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob` API, check the `JobStatus` field in the response. Once the job reaches a `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` status, use the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult` API to obtain the URLs for the generated files. If the job fails, the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult` API returns detailed information about the error that occurred.

            **StartDashboardSnapshotJob API throttling**

            Quick Sight utilizes API throttling to create a more consistent user experience within a time span for customers when they call the `StartDashboardSnapshotJob`. By default, 12 jobs can run simlutaneously in one Amazon Web Services account and users can submit up 10 API requests per second before an account is throttled. If an overwhelming number of API requests are made by the same user in a short period of time, Quick Sight throttles the API calls to maintin an optimal experience and reliability for all Quick Sight users.

            **Common throttling scenarios**

            The following list provides information about the most commin throttling scenarios that can occur.

            - **A large number of `SnapshotExport` API jobs are running simultaneously on an Amazon Web Services account.** When a new `StartDashboardSnapshotJob` is created and there are already 12 jobs with the `RUNNING` status, the new job request fails and returns a `LimitExceededException` error. Wait for a current job to comlpete before you resubmit the new job.
            - **A large number of API requests are submitted on an Amazon Web Services account.** When a user makes more than 10 API calls to the Quick Sight API in one second, a `ThrottlingException` is returned.

            If your use case requires a higher throttling limit, contact your account admin or [Amazon Web ServicesSupport](http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) to explore options to tailor a more optimal expereince for your account.

            **Best practices to handle throttling**

            If your use case projects high levels of API traffic, try to reduce the degree of frequency and parallelism of API calls as much as you can to avoid throttling. You can also perform a timing test to calculate an estimate for the total processing time of your projected load that stays within the throttling limits of the Quick Sight APIs. For example, if your projected traffic is 100 snapshot jobs before 12:00 PM per day, start 12 jobs in parallel and measure the amount of time it takes to proccess all 12 jobs. Once you obtain the result, multiply the duration by 9, for example `(12 minutes * 9 = 108 minutes)`. Use the new result to determine the latest time at which the jobs need to be started to meet your target deadline.

            The time that it takes to process a job can be impacted by the following factors:

            - The dataset type (Direct Query or SPICE).
            - The size of the dataset.
            - The complexity of the calculated fields that are used in the dashboard.
            - The number of visuals that are on a sheet.
            - The types of visuals that are on the sheet.
            - The number of formats and snapshots that are requested in the job configuration.
            - The size of the generated snapshots.

            This API controls public sharing settings for your entire Quick Sight account, affecting data security and access. When you enable public sharing:

            - Dashboards can be shared publicly
            - This setting affects your entire Amazon Web Services account and all Quick Sight users

            **Before proceeding:** Ensure you understand the security implications and have proper IAM permissions configured.

            Use the `UpdatePublicSharingSettings` operation to turn on or turn off the public sharing settings of an Amazon Quick Sight dashboard.

            To use this operation, turn on session capacity pricing for your Amazon Quick Sight account.

            Before you can turn on public sharing on your account, make sure to give public sharing permissions to an administrative user in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console. For more information on using IAM with Amazon Quick Sight, see [Using Quick Suite with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html) in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*.

            Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon Quick Sight experience in your website. This action can be used for any type of user that is registered in an Amazon Quick Sight account that uses IAM Identity Center for authentication. This API requires [identity-enhanced IAM Role sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-overview.html#types-identity-enhanced-iam-role-sessions) for the authenticated user that the API call is being made for.

            This API uses [trusted identity propagation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation.html) to ensure that an end user is authenticated and receives the embed URL that is specific to that user. The IAM Identity Center application that the user has logged into needs to have [trusted Identity Propagation enabled for Amazon Quick Sight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-using-customermanagedapps-specify-trusted-apps.html) with the scope value set to `quicksight:read`. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the relevant Amazon Quick Sight resource and permissions.

            Before you use this operation, make sure that you can connect to an existing Amazon Web Services account. If you don't have an Amazon Web Services account, see [Sign up for Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/setting-up-aws-sign-up.html) in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*. The person who signs up for Amazon Quick Sight needs to have the correct Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. For more information, see [IAM Policy Examples for Amazon Quick Sight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html) in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*.

            If your IAM policy includes both the `Subscribe` and `CreateAccountSubscription` actions, make sure that both actions are set to `Allow`. If either action is set to `Deny`, the `Deny` action prevails and your API call fails.

            You can't pass an existing IAM role to access other Amazon Web Services services using this API operation. To pass your existing IAM role to Amazon Quick Sight, see [Passing IAM roles to Amazon Quick Sight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security-create-iam-role) in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*.

            You can't set default resource access on the new account from the Amazon Quick Sight API. Instead, add default resource access from the Amazon Quick Sight console.

Generally speaking, these users have access to Quick Sight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace.\n  \n  To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings.

To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.\n- `Applied customizations` - Quick Sight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account."

            Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon Quick Suite dashboard or visual in your website, without having to register any reader users. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the dashboards and permissions.

            The following rules apply to the generated URL:

            - It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after it is generated. Once redeemed within this period, it cannot be re-used again.
            - The URL validity period should not be confused with the actual session lifetime that can be customized using the `SessionLifetimeInMinutes` parameter. The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (minimum) to 10 hours (maximum). The default session duration is 10 hours.
            - You are charged only when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon Quick Suite.

            For more information, see [Embedded Analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics.html) in the *Amazon Quick Suite User Guide*.

When this is set to `DISABLED`, Amazon Quick Sight disables the left filter pane on the published dashboard, which can be used for ad hoc (one-time) filtering. This option is `ENABLED` by default.
                - `AvailabilityStatus` for `ExportToCSVOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. The visual option to export data to .CSV format isn't enabled when this is set to `DISABLED`. This option is `ENABLED` by default.
                - `VisibilityState` for `SheetControlsOption` - This visibility state can be either `COLLAPSED` or `EXPANDED`. This option is `COLLAPSED` by default.
                - `AvailabilityStatus` for `QuickSuiteActionsOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. Features related to Actions in Amazon Quick Suite on dashboards are disabled when this is set to `DISABLED`. This option is `DISABLED` by default.
                - `AvailabilityStatus` for `ExecutiveSummaryOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. The option to build an executive summary is disabled when this is set to `DISABLED`. This option is `ENABLED` by default.
                - `AvailabilityStatus` for `DataStoriesSharingOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. The option to share a data story is disabled when this is set to `DISABLED`. This option is `ENABLED` by default.

            source-entity: |-
                The entity that you are using as a source when you create the dashboard. In `SourceEntity`, you specify the type of object you're using as source. You can only create a dashboard from a template, so you use a `SourceTemplate` entity. If you need to create a dashboard from an analysis, first convert the analysis to a template by using the `CreateTemplate` API operation. For `SourceTemplate`, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source template. The `SourceTemplate`ARN can contain any Amazon Web Services account and any Amazon Quick Sight-supported Amazon Web Services Region.

                Use the `DataSetReferences` entity within `SourceTemplate` to list the replacement datasets for the placeholders listed in the original. The schema in each dataset must match its placeholder.

                Either a `SourceEntity` or a `Definition` must be provided in order for the request to be valid.
            tags: Contains a map of the key-value pairs for the resource tag or tags assigned to the dashboard.
            theme-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the theme that is being used for this dashboard. If you add a value for this field, it overrides the value that is used in the source entity. The theme ARN must exist in the same Amazon Web Services account where you create the dashboard.
            validation-strategy: The option to relax the validation needed to create a dashboard with definition objects. This option skips the validation step for specific errors.

        command: |-
            (Enterprise edition only) Creates a new namespace for you to use with Amazon Quick Sight.

            A namespace allows you to isolate the Quick Sight users and groups that are registered for that namespace. Users that access the namespace can share assets only with other users or groups in the same namespace. They can't see users and groups in other namespaces. You can create a namespace after your Amazon Web Services account is subscribed to Quick Sight. The namespace must be unique within the Amazon Web Services account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per Amazon Web Services account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with Amazon Web Services Support.
        flag:
            aws-account-id: The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that you want to create the Quick Sight namespace in.

Export jobs run asynchronously and can be polled with a `DescribeAssetBundleExportJob` API call. When a job is successfully completed, a download URL that contains the exported assets is returned. The URL is valid for 5 minutes and can be refreshed with a `DescribeAssetBundleExportJob` API call. Each Amazon Quick Sight account can run up to 5 export jobs concurrently.

            This API uses [trusted identity propagation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation.html) to ensure that an end user is authenticated and receives the embed URL that is specific to that user. The IAM Identity Center application that the user has logged into needs to have [trusted Identity Propagation enabled for Quick Suite](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-using-customermanagedapps-specify-trusted-apps.html) with the scope value set to `quicksight:read`. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the relevant Quick Suite resource and permissions.

            We recommend enabling the `QSearchStatus` API to unlock the full potential of `PredictQnA`. When `QSearchStatus` is enabled, it first checks the specified dashboard for any existing visuals that match the question. If no matching visuals are found, `PredictQnA` uses generative Q&amp;A to provide an answer. To update the `QSearchStatus`, see [UpdateQuickSightQSearchConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateQuickSightQSearchConfiguration.html).

            Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon Quick Sight resource.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the `TagResource` operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. Amazon Quick Sight supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, template, topic, and user.

            Tagging for Amazon Quick Sight works in a similar way to tagging for other Amazon Web Services services, except for the following:

            - Tags are used to track costs for users in Amazon Quick Sight. You can't tag other resources that Amazon Quick Sight costs are based on, such as storage capacoty (SPICE), session usage, alert consumption, or reporting units.
            - Amazon Quick Sight doesn't currently support the tag editor for Resource Groups.

If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon Quick Sight attaches a `DeletionTime` stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon Quick Sight deletes the analysis permanently.

            At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the `RestoreAnalysis` API operation to remove the `DeletionTime` stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.

            Creates Amazon Quick Sight customizations. Currently, you can add a custom default theme by using the `CreateAccountCustomization` or `UpdateAccountCustomization` API operation. To further customize Amazon Quick Sight by removing Amazon Quick Sight sample assets and videos for all new users, see [Customizing Quick Sight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/customizing-quicksight.html) in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide.*

            You can create customizations for your Amazon Web Services account or, if you specify a namespace, for a Quick Sight namespace instead. Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an Amazon Web Services account. To find out which customizations apply, use the `DescribeAccountCustomization` API operation.

            Before you use the `CreateAccountCustomization` API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the `DescribeThemePermissions` API operation. To share the theme, grant permissions by using the `UpdateThemePermissions` API operation.

Or, you can add a custom theme by specifying `"AccountCustomization": { "DefaultTheme": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-west-2:111122223333:theme/bdb844d0-0fe9-4d9d-b520-0fe602d93639" }`.

            source-entity: |-
                The entity that you are using as a source when you create the template. In `SourceEntity`, you specify the type of object you're using as source: `SourceTemplate` for a template or `SourceAnalysis` for an analysis. Both of these require an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For `SourceTemplate`, specify the ARN of the source template. For `SourceAnalysis`, specify the ARN of the source analysis. The `SourceTemplate` ARN can contain any Amazon Web Services account and any Quick Sight-supported Amazon Web Services Region.

                Use the `DataSetReferences` entity within `SourceTemplate` or `SourceAnalysis` to list the replacement datasets for the placeholders listed in the original. The schema in each dataset must match its placeholder.

This parameter should only be used when `ExternalLoginFederationProviderType` parameter is set to `CUSTOM_OIDC`.
            custom-permissions-name: |-
                (Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions allows you to control a user's access by restricting access the following operations:

                - Create and update data sources
                - Create and update datasets
                - Create and update email reports
                - Subscribe to email reports

                A set of custom permissions includes any combination of these restrictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for custom permission sets by using the Quick Sight console. Then, you use the `RegisterUser` API operation to assign the named set of permissions to a Quick Sight user.

                Quick Sight custom permissions are applied through IAM policies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by assigning Quick Sight users to one of the default security cohorts in Quick Sight (admin, author, reader).

                This feature is available only to Quick Sight Enterprise edition subscriptions.

                The type of supported external login provider that provides identity to let a user federate into Quick Sight with an associated Identity and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported external login provider can be one of the following.

                - `COGNITO`: Amazon Cognito. The provider URL is cognito-identity.amazonaws.com. When choosing the `COGNITO` provider type, don’t use the "CustomFederationProviderUrl" parameter which is only needed when the external provider is custom.
                - `CUSTOM_OIDC`: Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing `CUSTOM_OIDC` type, use the `CustomFederationProviderUrl` parameter to provide the custom OIDC provider URL.
                - `NONE`: This clears all the previously saved external login information for a user. Use the `DescribeUser` API operation to check the external login information.
            external-login-id: The identity ID for a user in the external login provider.

            role: |-
                The Amazon Quick Sight role of the user. The role can be one of the following default security cohorts:

                - `READER`: A user who has read-only access to dashboards.
                - `AUTHOR`: A user who can create data sources, datasets, analyses, and dashboards.
                - `ADMIN`: A user who is an author, who can also manage Amazon Quick Sight settings.
                - `READER_PRO`: Reader Pro adds Generative BI capabilities to the Reader role. Reader Pros have access to Amazon Q in Quick Sight, can build stories with Amazon Q, and can generate executive summaries from dashboards.
                - `AUTHOR_PRO`: Author Pro adds Generative BI capabilities to the Author role. Author Pros can author dashboards with natural language with Amazon Q, build stories with Amazon Q, create Topics for Q&amp;A, and generate executive summaries from dashboards.
                - `ADMIN_PRO`: Admin Pros are Author Pros who can also manage Amazon Quick Sight administrative settings. Admin Pro users are billed at Author Pro pricing.

                The name of the Quick Sight role is invisible to the user except for the console screens dealing with permissions.
            unapply-custom-permissions: A flag that you use to indicate that you want to remove all custom permissions from this user. Using this parameter resets the user to the state it was in before a custom permissions profile was applied. This parameter defaults to NULL and it doesn't accept any other value.
            user-name: The Amazon Quick Sight user name that you want to update.
