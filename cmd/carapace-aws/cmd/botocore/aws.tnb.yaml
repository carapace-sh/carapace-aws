            A network package is a .zip file in CSAR (Cloud Service Archive) format defines the function packages you want to deploy and the Amazon Web Services infrastructure you want to deploy them on. For more information, see [Network instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tnb/latest/ug/network-instances.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Telco Network Builder User Guide*.

            A network package consists of a network service descriptor (NSD) file (required) and any additional files (optional), such as scripts specific to your needs. For example, if you have multiple function packages in your network package, you can use the NSD to define which network functions should run in certain VPCs, subnets, or EKS clusters.

            This request creates an empty network package container with an ID. Once you create a network package, you can upload the network package content using [PutSolNetworkPackageContent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tnb/latest/APIReference/API_PutSolNetworkPackageContent.html).

            Deletes a network instance.

            A network instance is a single network created in Amazon Web Services TNB that can be deployed and on which life-cycle operations (like terminate, update, and delete) can be performed.

            To delete a network instance, the instance must be in a stopped or terminated state. To terminate a network instance, see [TerminateSolNetworkInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tnb/latest/APIReference/API_TerminateSolNetworkInstance.html).

The next step is to upload the actual CSAR zip file into that empty container.
