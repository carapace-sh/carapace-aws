            Returns the refresh status of the Trusted Advisor checks that have the specified check IDs. You can get the check IDs by calling the [DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks]() operation.

            Some checks are refreshed automatically, and you can't return their refresh statuses by using the `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses` operation. If you call this operation for these checks, you might see an `InvalidParameterValue` error.

            - If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears.

            Creates a case in the Amazon Web Services Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case in the Amazon Web Services Support Center [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.

            The Amazon Web Services Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the following ways:

            - Submit a request from the Amazon Web Services Support Center [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.
            - Use the Service Quotas [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html) operation.

            A successful `CreateCase` request returns an Amazon Web Services Support case number. You can use the [DescribeCases]() operation and specify the case number to get existing Amazon Web Services Support cases. After you create a case, use the [AddCommunicationToCase]() operation to add additional communication or attachments to an existing case.

            The `caseId` is separate from the `displayId` that appears in the [Amazon Web Services Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support). Use the [DescribeCases]() operation to get the `displayId`.

            - You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
            - If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [Amazon Web Services Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).
        flag:
            attachment-set-id: The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create the set by using the [AddAttachmentsToSet]() operation.
            category-code: The category of problem for the support case. You also use the [DescribeServices]() operation to get the category code for a service. Each Amazon Web Services service defines its own set of category codes.
            cc-email-addresses: A list of email addresses that Amazon Web Services Support copies on case correspondence. Amazon Web Services Support identifies the account that creates the case when you specify your Amazon Web Services credentials in an HTTP POST method or use the [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

            Some checks are refreshed automatically. If you call the `RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck` operation to refresh them, you might see the `InvalidParameterValue` error.

            The response contains a [TrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatus]() object.
