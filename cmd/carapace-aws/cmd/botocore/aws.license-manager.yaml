                Filters to scope the results. The following filters and logical operators are supported:

                - `licenseCountingType` - The dimension for which licenses are counted. Possible values are `vCPU` | `Instance` | `Core` | `Socket`.
                - `enforceLicenseCount` - A Boolean value that indicates whether hard license enforcement is used.
                - `usagelimitExceeded` - A Boolean value that indicates whether the available licenses have been exceeded.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            license-configuration-arns: Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the license configurations.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: Maximum number of results to return in a single call.
            next-token: Token for the next set of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            license-rules: |-
                License rules. The syntax is #name=value (for example, #allowedTenancy=EC2-DedicatedHost). The available rules vary by dimension, as follows.

                - `Cores` dimension: `allowedTenancy` | `licenseAffinityToHost` | `maximumCores` | `minimumCores`
                - `Instances` dimension: `allowedTenancy` | `maximumVcpus` | `minimumVcpus`
                - `Sockets` dimension: `allowedTenancy` | `licenseAffinityToHost` | `maximumSockets` | `minimumSockets`
                - `vCPUs` dimension: `allowedTenancy` | `honorVcpuOptimization` | `maximumVcpus` | `minimumVcpus`

                The unit for `licenseAffinityToHost` is days and the range is 1 to 180. The possible values for `allowedTenancy` are `EC2-Default`, `EC2-DedicatedHost`, and `EC2-DedicatedInstance`. The possible values for `honorVcpuOptimization` are `True` and `False`.
