            Returns a list of entities that have been affected by the specified events, based on the specified filter criteria. Entities can refer to individual customer resources, groups of customer resources, or any other construct, depending on the Amazon Web Services service. Events that have impact beyond that of the affected entities, or where the extent of impact is unknown, include at least one entity indicating this.

            At least one event ARN is required.

            - This API operation uses pagination. Specify the `nextToken` parameter in the next request to return more results.
            - This operation supports resource-level permissions. You can use this operation to allow or deny access to specific Health events. For more information, see [Resource- and action-based conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#resource-action-based-conditions) in the *Health User Guide*.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Returns detailed information about one or more specified events for one or more Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization. This information includes standard event data (such as the Amazon Web Services Region and service), an event description, and (depending on the event) possible metadata. This operation doesn't return affected entities, such as the resources related to the event. To return affected entities, use the [DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization.html) operation.

            Before you can call this operation, you must first enable Health to work with Organizations. To do this, call the [EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html) operation from your organization's management account.

            When you call the `DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization` operation, specify the `organizationEventDetailFilters` object in the request. Depending on the Health event type, note the following differences:

            - To return event details for a public event, you must specify a null value for the `awsAccountId` parameter. If you specify an account ID for a public event, Health returns an error message because public events aren't specific to an account.
            - To return event details for an event that is specific to an account in your organization, you must specify the `awsAccountId` parameter in the request. If you don't specify an account ID, Health returns an error message because the event is specific to an account in your organization.

            For more information, see [Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html).

            This operation doesn't support resource-level permissions. You can't use this operation to allow or deny access to specific Health events. For more information, see [Resource- and action-based conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#resource-action-based-conditions) in the *Health User Guide*.

            Returns information about events that meet the specified filter criteria. Events are returned in a summary form and do not include the detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the [DescribeEventDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetails.html) and [DescribeAffectedEntities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntities.html) operations.

            - When you call the `DescribeEvents` operation and specify an entity for the `entityValues` parameter, Health might return public events that aren't specific to that resource. For example, if you call `DescribeEvents` and specify an ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, Health might return events that aren't specific to that resource or service. To get events that are specific to a service, use the `services` parameter in the `filter` object.

            Returns information about events across your organization in Organizations. You can use the`filters` parameter to specify the events that you want to return. Events are returned in a summary form and don't include the affected accounts, detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the following operations:

            - [DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization.html)
            - [DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization.html)
            - [DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization.html)

            If you don't specify a `filter`, the `DescribeEventsForOrganizations` returns all events across your organization. Results are sorted by `lastModifiedTime`, starting with the most recent event.

            For more information about the different types of Health events, see [Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html).

            Before you can call this operation, you must first enable Health to work with Organizations. To do this, call the [EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html) operation from your organization's management account.

            This API operation uses pagination. Specify the `nextToken` parameter in the next request to return more results.

                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of items to return in one batch, between 10 and 100, inclusive.
            next-token: If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a `nextToken` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            Enables Health to work with Organizations. You can use the organizational view feature to aggregate events from all Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization in a centralized location.

            This operation also creates a service-linked role for the management account in the organization.

            To call this operation, you must meet the following requirements:

            - You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from [Amazon Web Services Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a `SubscriptionRequiredException` error.
            - You must have permission to call this operation from the organization's management account. For example IAM policies, see [Health identity-based policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html).

            If you don't have the required support plan, you can instead use the Health console to enable the organizational view feature. For more information, see [Aggregating Health events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html) in the *Health User Guide*.

        Health

        The Health API provides access to the Health information that appears in the [Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home). You can use the API operations to get information about events that might affect your Amazon Web Services services and resources.

        You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from [Amazon Web Services Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a `SubscriptionRequiredException` error.

        For API access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information, see [Best practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

        You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the API. For more information, see [Accessing the Health API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html) in the *Health User Guide*.

        For authentication of requests, Health uses the [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

        If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations, you can use the Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event information. For more information, see [Aggregating Health events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html) in the *Health User Guide*.

        When you use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the following recommendations:

        - Use the [eventScopeCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode) parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public or account-specific.
        - Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you call the `DescribeEventsForOrganization` operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the `nextToken` in the next request to return more results.
