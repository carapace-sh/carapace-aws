        command: |-
            Reboots some, or all, of the cache nodes within a provisioned cluster. This operation applies any modified cache parameter groups to the cluster. The reboot operation takes place as soon as possible, and results in a momentary outage to the cluster. During the reboot, the cluster status is set to REBOOTING.

            The reboot causes the contents of the cache (for each cache node being rebooted) to be lost.

            When the reboot is complete, a cluster event is created.

            Rebooting a cluster is currently supported on Memcached, Valkey and Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) clusters. Rebooting is not supported on Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) clusters.

            If you make changes to parameters that require a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster reboot for the changes to be applied, see [Rebooting a Cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/nodes.rebooting.html) for an alternate process.

            This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication group or a secondary replication group associated with a Global datastore.

            A Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication group is a collection of nodes, where one of the nodes is a read/write primary and the others are read-only replicas. Writes to the primary are asynchronously propagated to the replicas.

            A Valkey or Redis OSS cluster-mode enabled cluster is comprised of from 1 to 90 shards (API/CLI: node groups). Each shard has a primary node and up to 5 read-only replica nodes. The configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number or replicas allowed.

            The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the Valkey or Redis OSS engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you can choose to configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between 83 shards (one primary and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase. Common pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information, see [Creating a Subnet Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/SubnetGroups.Creating.html). For versions below 5.0.6, the limit is 250 per cluster.

            To request a limit increase, see [Amazon Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) and choose the limit type **Nodes per cluster per instance type**.

            When a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been successfully created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a total of 5 read replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the number of node groups (console: shards), you can use scaling. For more information, see [Scaling self-designed clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/Scaling.html) in the *ElastiCache User Guide*.

            This operation is valid for Valkey and Redis OSS only.

            cluster-mode: Enabled or Disabled. To modify cluster mode from Disabled to Enabled, you must first set the cluster mode to Compatible. Compatible mode allows your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to connect using both cluster mode enabled and cluster mode disabled. After you migrate all Valkey or Redis OSS clients to use cluster mode enabled, you can then complete cluster mode configuration and set the cluster mode to Enabled.
            data-tiering-enabled: Enables data tiering. Data tiering is only supported for replication groups using the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set to true when using r6gd nodes. For more information, see [Data tiering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/data-tiering.html).
            engine: The name of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this replication group. The value must be set to `valkey` or `redis`.
            engine-version: |-
                The version number of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this replication group. To view the supported cache engine versions, use the `DescribeCacheEngineVersions` operation.

                **Important:** You can upgrade to a newer engine version (see [Selecting a Cache Engine and Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/SelectEngine.html#VersionManagement)) in the *ElastiCache User Guide*, but you cannot downgrade to an earlier engine version. If you want to use an earlier engine version, you must delete the existing cluster or replication group and create it anew with the earlier engine version.

            node-group-configuration: |-
                A list of node group (shard) configuration options. Each node group (shard) configuration has the following members: `PrimaryAvailabilityZone`, `ReplicaAvailabilityZones`, `ReplicaCount`, and `Slots`.

                If you're creating a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) or a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group, you can use this parameter to individually configure each node group (shard), or you can omit this parameter. However, it is required when seeding a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster from a S3 rdb file. You must configure each node group (shard) using this parameter because you must specify the slots for each node group.
            notification-topic-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to which notifications are sent.

                If `AutomaticFailoverEnabled` is `true`, the value of this parameter must be at least 2. If `AutomaticFailoverEnabled` is `false` you can omit this parameter (it will default to 1), or you can explicitly set it to a value between 2 and 6.

                The maximum permitted value for `NumCacheClusters` is 6 (1 primary plus 5 replicas).
            num-node-groups: |-
                An optional parameter that specifies the number of node groups (shards) for this Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) either omit this parameter or set it to 1.

                Default: 1
            port: The port number on which each member of the replication group accepts connections.
            preferred-cache-cluster-a-zs: |-
                A list of EC2 Availability Zones in which the replication group's clusters are created. The order of the Availability Zones in the list is the order in which clusters are allocated. The primary cluster is created in the first AZ in the list.

                This parameter is not used if there is more than one node group (shard). You should use `NodeGroupConfiguration` instead.

                If you are creating your replication group in an Amazon VPC (recommended), you can only locate clusters in Availability Zones associated with the subnets in the selected subnet group.

                The number of Availability Zones listed must equal the value of `NumCacheClusters`.

                Default: system chosen Availability Zones.
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.

                This parameter is not required if `NumCacheClusters`, `NumNodeGroups`, or `ReplicasPerNodeGroup` is specified.
            replicas-per-node-group: An optional parameter that specifies the number of replica nodes in each node group (shard). Valid values are 0 to 5.
            replication-group-description: A user-created description for the replication group.
            replication-group-id: |-
                The replication group identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

                Constraints:

                - A name must contain from 1 to 40 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.
                - The first character must be a letter.
                - A name cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
            security-group-ids: |-
                One or more Amazon VPC security groups associated with this replication group.

                Use this parameter only when you are creating a replication group in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
            serverless-cache-snapshot-name: The name of the snapshot used to create a replication group. Available for Valkey, Redis OSS only.
            snapshot-arns: |-
                A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARN) that uniquely identify the Valkey or Redis OSS RDB snapshot files stored in Amazon S3. The snapshot files are used to populate the new replication group. The Amazon S3 object name in the ARN cannot contain any commas. The new replication group will have the number of node groups (console: shards) specified by the parameter *NumNodeGroups* or the number of node groups configured by *NodeGroupConfiguration* regardless of the number of ARNs specified here.

                Example of an Amazon S3 ARN: `arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/snapshot1.rdb`
            snapshot-name: The name of a snapshot from which to restore data into the new replication group. The snapshot status changes to `restoring` while the new replication group is being created.
            snapshot-retention-limit: |-
                The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set `SnapshotRetentionLimit` to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

                Default: 0 (i.e., automatic backups are disabled for this cluster).
            snapshot-window: |-
                The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your node group (shard).

                Example: `05:00-09:00`

                If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.
            tags: 'A list of tags to be added to this resource. Tags are comma-separated key,value pairs (e.g. Key=`myKey`, Value=`myKeyValue`. You can include multiple tags as shown following: Key=`myKey`, Value=`myKeyValue` Key=`mySecondKey`, Value=`mySecondKeyValue`. Tags on replication groups will be replicated to all nodes.'
            transit-encryption-enabled: |-
                A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to `true`.

                This parameter is valid only if the `Engine` parameter is `redis`, the `EngineVersion` parameter is `3.2.6`, `4.x` or later, and the cluster is being created in an Amazon VPC.

                If you enable in-transit encryption, you must also specify a value for `CacheSubnetGroup`.

                **Required:** Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version `3.2.6`, `4.x` or later.

                Default: `false`

                For HIPAA compliance, you must specify `TransitEncryptionEnabled` as `true`, an `AuthToken`, and a `CacheSubnetGroup`.
            transit-encryption-mode: |-
                A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime.

                When setting `TransitEncryptionEnabled` to `true`, you can set your `TransitEncryptionMode` to `preferred` in the same request, to allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections at the same time. Once you migrate all your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to use encrypted connections you can modify the value to `required` to allow encrypted connections only.

                Setting `TransitEncryptionMode` to `required` is a two-step process that requires you to first set the `TransitEncryptionMode` to `preferred`, after that you can set `TransitEncryptionMode` to `required`.

                This process will not trigger the replacement of the replication group.
            user-group-ids: The user group to associate with the replication group.

            Global Datastore offers fully managed, fast, reliable and secure cross-region replication. Using Global Datastore with Valkey or Redis OSS, you can create cross-region read replica clusters for ElastiCache to enable low-latency reads and disaster recovery across regions. For more information, see [Replication Across Regions Using Global Datastore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/Redis-Global-Datastore.html).

            - The **GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix** is the name of the Global datastore.
            - The **PrimaryReplicationGroupId** represents the name of the primary cluster that accepts writes and will replicate updates to the secondary cluster.

                The suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automatically applies a prefix to the Global datastore ID when it is created. Each Amazon Region has its own prefix. For instance, a Global datastore ID created in the US-West-1 region will begin with "dsdfu" along with the suffix name you provide. The suffix, combined with the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of the Global datastore name across multiple regions.

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications are sent.

                The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the replication group owner.
            notification-topic-status: |-
                The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic for the replication group. Notifications are sent only if the status is `active`.

                Valid values: `active` | `inactive`
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.

                Valid values for `ddd` are:

                - `sun`
                - `mon`
                - `tue`
                - `wed`
                - `thu`
                - `fri`
                - `sat`

                Example: `sun:23:00-mon:01:30`
            primary-cluster-id: For replication groups with a single primary, if this parameter is specified, ElastiCache promotes the specified cluster in the specified replication group to the primary role. The nodes of all other clusters in the replication group are read replicas.
            remove-user-groups: Removes the user group associated with this replication group.
            replication-group-description: A description for the replication group. Maximum length is 255 characters.
            replication-group-id: The identifier of the replication group to modify.
            security-group-ids: |-
                Specifies the VPC Security Groups associated with the clusters in the replication group.

                This parameter can be used only with replication group containing clusters running in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
            snapshot-retention-limit: |-
                The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic node group (shard) snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set `SnapshotRetentionLimit` to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

                **Important** If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0), backups are turned off.
            snapshot-window: |-
                The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of the node group (shard) specified by `SnapshottingClusterId`.

                Example: `05:00-09:00`

                If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.
            snapshotting-cluster-id: The cluster ID that is used as the daily snapshot source for the replication group. This parameter cannot be set for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication groups.
            transit-encryption-enabled: A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true. If you are enabling in-transit encryption for an existing cluster, you must also set `TransitEncryptionMode` to `preferred`.
            transit-encryption-mode: |-
                A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime.

                You must set `TransitEncryptionEnabled` to `true`, for your existing cluster, and set `TransitEncryptionMode` to `preferred` in the same request to allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections at the same time. Once you migrate all your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to use encrypted connections you can set the value to `required` to allow encrypted connections only.

                Setting `TransitEncryptionMode` to `required` is a two-step process that requires you to first set the `TransitEncryptionMode` to `preferred`, after that you can set `TransitEncryptionMode` to `required`.
            user-group-ids-to-add: The ID of the user group you are associating with the replication group.
            user-group-ids-to-remove: The ID of the user group to disassociate from the replication group, meaning the users in the group no longer can access the replication group.

For guidance on how to move existing Memcached nodes to different Availability Zones, see the **Availability Zone Considerations** section of [Cache Node Considerations for Memcached](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/CacheNodes.SupportedTypes.html).\n\n**Impact of new add/remove requests upon pending requests**\n\n- Scenario-1\n  \n  - Pending Action: Delete\n  - New Request: Delete\n  - Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete.\n- Scenario-2\n  \n  - Pending Action: Delete\n  - New Request: Create\n  - Result: The new create, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete.\n- Scenario-3\n  \n  - Pending Action: Create\n  - New Request: Delete\n  - Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending create.\n- Scenario-4\n  \n  - Pending Action: Create\n  - New Request: Create\n  - Result: The new create is added to the pending create.\n    \n    **Important:** If the new create request is **Apply Immediately - Yes**, all creates are performed immediately. If the new create request is **Apply Immediately - No**, all creates are pending."
            notification-topic-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications are sent.

                The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the cluster owner.
            notification-topic-status: |-
                The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic. Notifications are sent only if the status is `active`.

                Valid values: `active` | `inactive`
            num-cache-nodes: |-
                The number of cache nodes that the cluster should have. If the value for `NumCacheNodes` is greater than the sum of the number of current cache nodes and the number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero), more nodes are added. If the value is less than the number of existing cache nodes, nodes are removed. If the value is equal to the number of current cache nodes, any pending add or remove requests are canceled.

                If you are removing cache nodes, you must use the `CacheNodeIdsToRemove` parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to remove.

                For clusters running Valkey or Redis OSS, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40.

                Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied immediately or as a pending operation (see `ApplyImmediately`).

                A pending operation to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster during its maintenance window, whether by adding or removing nodes in accordance with the scale out architecture, is not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove nodes to the cluster overrides any previous pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a request to remove 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a request to add 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes and vice versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be provisioned in different Availability Zones with flexible cache node placement, a request to add nodes does not automatically override a previous pending operation to add nodes. The customer can modify the previous pending operation to add more nodes or explicitly cancel the pending request and retry the new request. To cancel pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster, use the `ModifyCacheCluster` request and set `NumCacheNodes` equal to the number of cache nodes currently in the cluster.
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.

                Valid values for `ddd` are:

                - `sun`
                - `mon`
                - `tue`

                - `thu`
                - `fri`

                Specifies the VPC Security Groups associated with the cluster.

                This parameter can be used only with clusters that are created in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
            snapshot-retention-limit: |-
                The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic cluster snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set `SnapshotRetentionLimit` to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

                If the value of `SnapshotRetentionLimit` is set to zero (0), backups are turned off.
            snapshot-window: The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your cluster.

            A tag is a key-value pair where the key and value are case-sensitive. You can use tags to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the exception of global replication group. When you add or remove tags on replication groups, those actions will be replicated to all nodes in the replication group. For more information, see [Resource-level permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/IAM.ResourceLevelPermissions.html).

            For example, you can use cost-allocation tags to your ElastiCache resources, Amazon generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.

            For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags in Amazon ElastiCache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/Tagging.html) in the *ElastiCache User Guide*.

            Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process:

            - First, you must [DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup]() to remove the secondary clusters in the Global datastore.
            - Once the Global datastore contains only the primary cluster, you can use the `DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup` API to delete the Global datastore while retainining the primary cluster using `RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true`.

            Since the Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting `RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true`. The primary cluster is never deleted when deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it no longer is associated with any Global Datastore.

            When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.

                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                max-records: |-
                    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

                    Default: 100

                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
