            cluster-type: |-
                Specifies the type of KDB database that is being created. The following types are available:

                - HDB – A Historical Database. The data is only accessible with read-only permissions from one of the FinSpace managed kdb databases mounted to the cluster.
                - RDB – A Realtime Database. This type of database captures all the data from a ticker plant and stores it in memory until the end of day, after which it writes all of its data to a disk and reloads the HDB. This cluster type requires local storage for temporary storage of data during the savedown process. If you specify this field in your request, you must provide the `savedownStorageConfiguration` parameter.
                - GATEWAY – A gateway cluster allows you to access data across processes in kdb systems. It allows you to create your own routing logic using the initialization scripts and custom code. This type of cluster does not require a writable local storage.
                - GP – A general purpose cluster allows you to quickly iterate on code during development by granting greater access to system commands and enabling a fast reload of custom code. This cluster type can optionally mount databases including cache and savedown storage. For this cluster type, the node count is fixed at 1. It does not support autoscaling and supports only `SINGLE` AZ mode.
                - Tickerplant – A tickerplant cluster allows you to subscribe to feed handlers based on IAM permissions. It can publish to RDBs, other Tickerplants, and real-time subscribers (RTS). Tickerplants can persist messages to log, which is readable by any RDB environment. It supports only single-node that is only one kdb process.
            code: The details of the custom code that you want to use inside a cluster when analyzing a data. It consists of the S3 source bucket, location, S3 object version, and the relative path from where the custom code is loaded into the cluster.
            command-line-arguments: Defines the key-value pairs to make them available inside the cluster.
            databases: A list of databases that will be available for querying.
            environment-id: A unique identifier for the kdb environment.
            execution-role: An IAM role that defines a set of permissions associated with a cluster. These permissions are assumed when a cluster attempts to access another cluster.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            initialization-script: Specifies a Q program that will be run at launch of a cluster. It is a relative path within *.zip* file that contains the custom code, which will be loaded on the cluster. It must include the file name itself. For example, `somedir/init.q`.
            release-label: The version of FinSpace managed kdb to run.
            savedown-storage-configuration: The size and type of the temporary storage that is used to hold data during the savedown process. This parameter is required when you choose `clusterType` as RDB. All the data written to this storage space is lost when the cluster node is restarted.
            scaling-group-configuration: The structure that stores the configuration details of a scaling group.
            tags: A list of key-value pairs to label the cluster. You can add up to 50 tags to a cluster.
            tickerplant-log-configuration: A configuration to store Tickerplant logs. It consists of a list of volumes that will be mounted to your cluster. For the cluster type `Tickerplant`, the location of the TP volume on the cluster will be available by using the global variable `.aws.tp_log_path`.
            vpc-configuration: Configuration details about the network where the Privatelink endpoint of the cluster resides.

                The option to specify whether you want to make the dataview writable to perform database maintenance. The following are some considerations related to writable dataviews.  

                - You cannot create partial writable dataviews. When you create writeable dataviews you must provide the entire database path.
                - You cannot perform updates on a writeable dataview. Hence, `autoUpdate` must be set as **False** if `readWrite` is **True** for a dataview.
                - You must also use a unique volume for creating a writeable dataview. So, if you choose a volume that is already in use by another dataview, the dataview creation fails.
                - Once you create a dataview as writeable, you cannot change it to read-only. So, you cannot update the `readWrite` parameter later.
            segment-configurations: The configuration that contains the database path of the data that you want to place on each selected volume. Each segment must have a unique database path for each volume. If you do not explicitly specify any database path for a volume, they are accessible from the cluster through the default S3/object store segment.
