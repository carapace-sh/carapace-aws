            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: Specifies the maximum number of results to return.
            next-token: A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to continue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of the previous page call.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to be returned per request that lists the tags for the resource.
            next-token: The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no additional results for this request, where the request lists the tags for the resource with the specified ARN.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-arn: Lists the tags for the resource with the specified ARN.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

This request does not execute the query but returns results. Use [StartQueryExecution]() to run a query.

            To stream query results successfully, the IAM principal with permission to call `GetQueryResults` also must have permissions to the Amazon S3 `GetObject` action for the Athena query results location.

            IAM principals with permission to the Amazon S3 `GetObject` action for the query results location are able to retrieve query results from Amazon S3 even if permission to the `GetQueryResults` action is denied. To restrict user or role access, ensure that Amazon S3 permissions to the Athena query location are denied.

Requires you to have access to the workgroup in which the queries were saved. Use [ListNamedQueriesInput]() to get the list of named query IDs in the specified workgroup. If information could not be retrieved for a submitted query ID, information about the query ID submitted is listed under [UnprocessedNamedQueryId](). Named queries differ from executed queries. Use [BatchGetQueryExecutionInput]() to get details about each unique query execution, and [ListQueryExecutionsInput]() to get a list of query execution IDs.

                The name of the data catalog to create. The catalog name must be unique for the Amazon Web Services account and can use a maximum of 127 alphanumeric, underscore, at sign, or hyphen characters. The remainder of the length constraint of 256 is reserved for use by Athena.

                For `FEDERATED` type the catalog name has following considerations and limits:

                - The catalog name allows special characters such as `_ , @ , \ , -`. These characters are replaced with a hyphen (-) when creating the CFN Stack Name and with an underscore (\_) when creating the Lambda Function and Glue Connection Name.
                - The catalog name has a theoretical limit of 128 characters. However, since we use it to create other resources that allow less characters and we prepend a prefix to it, the actual catalog name limit for `FEDERATED` catalog is 64 - 23 = 41 characters.
            parameters: "Specifies the Lambda function or functions to use for creating the data catalog. This is a mapping whose values depend on the catalog type.\n\n- For the `HIVE` data catalog type, use the following syntax. The `metadata-function` parameter is required. `The sdk-version` parameter is optional and defaults to the currently supported version.\n  \n  `metadata-function=lambda_arn, sdk-version=version_number`\n- For the `LAMBDA` data catalog type, use one of the following sets of required parameters, but not both.\n  \n  - If you have one Lambda function that processes metadata and another for reading the actual data, use the following syntax. Both parameters are required.\n    \n    `metadata-function=lambda_arn, record-function=lambda_arn`\n  - If you have a composite Lambda function that processes both metadata and data, use the following syntax to specify your Lambda function.\n    \n    `function=lambda_arn`\n- The `GLUE` type takes a catalog ID parameter and is required. The `catalog_id` is the account ID of the Amazon Web Services account to which the Glue Data Catalog belongs.\n  \n  `catalog-id=catalog_id`\n  \n  - The `GLUE` data catalog type also applies to the default `AwsDataCatalog` that already exists in your account, of which you can have only one and cannot modify.\n- The `FEDERATED` data catalog type uses one of the following parameters, but not both. Use `connection-arn` for an existing Glue connection. Use `connection-type` and `connection-properties` to specify the configuration setting for a new connection.\n  \n  - `connection-arn:<glue_connection_arn_to_reuse>`\n  - `lambda-role-arn` (optional): The execution role to use for the Lambda function. If not provided, one is created.\n  - `connection-type:MYSQL|REDSHIFT|...., connection-properties:\"<json_string>\"`\n    \n    For *`<json_string>`* , use escaped JSON text, as in the following example.\n    \n    `\"{\\\"spill_bucket\\\":\\\"my_spill\\\",\\\"spill_prefix\\\":\\\"athena-spill\\\",\\\"host\\\":\\\"abc12345.snowflakecomputing.com\\\",\\\"port\\\":\\\"1234\\\",\\\"warehouse\\\":\\\"DEV_WH\\\",\\\"database\\\":\\\"TEST\\\",\\\"schema\\\":\\\"PUBLIC\\\",\\\"SecretArn\\\":\\\"arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-south-1:111122223333:secret:snowflake-XHb67j\\\"}\"`"
            tags: A list of comma separated tags to add to the data catalog that is created. All the resources that are created by the `CreateDataCatalog` API operation with `FEDERATED` type will have the tag `federated_athena_datacatalog="true"`. This includes the CFN Stack, Glue Connection, Athena DataCatalog, and all the resources created as part of the CFN Stack (Lambda Function, IAM policies/roles).

        Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more information, see [What is Amazon Athena](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*.

        If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the driver or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see [Accessing Amazon Athena with JDBC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html).
