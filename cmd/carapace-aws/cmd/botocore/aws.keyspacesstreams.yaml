            keyspace-name: The name of the keyspace for which to list streams. If specified, only streams associated with tables in this keyspace are returned. If omitted, streams from all keyspaces are included in the results.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of streams to return in a single `ListStreams` request. Default value is 100. The minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 100.
            next-token: An optional pagination token provided by a previous `ListStreams` operation. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the token, up to the value specified by `maxResults`.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            table-name: The name of the table for which to list streams. Must be used together with `keyspaceName`. If specified, only streams associated with this specific table are returned.

            max-results: The maximum number of records to return in a single `GetRecords` request. Default value is 1000. You can specify a limit between 1 and 1000, but the actual number returned might be less than the specified maximum if the size of the data for the returned records exceeds the internal size limit.
            shard-iterator: The unique identifier of the shard iterator. A shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. You obtain this value by calling the `GetShardIterator` operation. Each shard iterator is valid for 15 minutes after creation.

                - `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` - Start reading exactly from the specified sequence number.
                - `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` - Start reading right after the specified sequence number.
                - `LATEST` - Start reading just after the most recent record in the shard, so that you always read the most recent data.
            stream-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to get the shard iterator. The ARN uniquely identifies the stream within Amazon Keyspaces.
