            Creates a snapshot of the specified simulation. A snapshot is a file that contains simulation state data at a specific time. The state data saved in a snapshot includes entity data from the State Fabric, the simulation configuration specified in the schema, and the clock tick number. You can use the snapshot to initialize a new simulation. For more information about snapshots, see [Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/working-with_snapshots.html) in the *SimSpace Weaver User Guide*.

            You specify a `Destination` when you create a snapshot. The `Destination` is the name of an Amazon S3 bucket and an optional `ObjectKeyPrefix`. The `ObjectKeyPrefix` is usually the name of a folder in the bucket. SimSpace Weaver creates a `snapshot` folder inside the `Destination` and places the snapshot file there.

            The snapshot file is an Amazon S3 object. It has an object key with the form: `object-key-prefix/snapshot/simulation-name-YYMMdd-HHmm-ss.zip`, where:

            - `YY` is the 2-digit year
            - `MM` is the 2-digit month
            - `dd` is the 2-digit day of the month
            - `HH` is the 2-digit hour (24-hour clock)

        SimSpace Weaver (SimSpace Weaver) is a service that you can use to build and run large-scale spatial simulations in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For example, you can create crowd simulations, large real-world environments, and immersive and interactive experiences. For more information about SimSpace Weaver, see the [*SimSpace Weaver User Guide*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/) .

        This API reference describes the API operations and data types that you can use to communicate directly with SimSpace Weaver.

        SimSpace Weaver also provides the SimSpace Weaver app SDK, which you use for app development. The SimSpace Weaver app SDK API reference is included in the SimSpace Weaver app SDK documentation. This documentation is part of the SimSpace Weaver app SDK distributable package.
