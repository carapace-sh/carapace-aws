      documentation:
        command: |-
            Starts an instance refresh.

            This operation is part of the [instance refresh feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html) in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group. This feature is helpful, for example, when you have a new AMI or a new user data script. You just need to create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then start an instance refresh to immediately begin the process of updating instances in the group.

            If successful, the request's response contains a unique ID that you can use to track the progress of the instance refresh. To query its status, call the [DescribeInstanceRefreshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeInstanceRefreshes.html) API. To describe the instance refreshes that have already run, call the [DescribeInstanceRefreshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeInstanceRefreshes.html) API. To cancel an instance refresh that is in progress, use the [CancelInstanceRefresh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CancelInstanceRefresh.html) API.

            An instance refresh might fail for several reasons, such as EC2 launch failures, misconfigured health checks, or not ignoring or allowing the termination of instances that are in `Standby` state or protected from scale in. You can monitor for failed EC2 launches using the scaling activities. To find the scaling activities, call the [DescribeScalingActivities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeScalingActivities.html) API.

            If you enable auto rollback, your Auto Scaling group will be rolled back automatically when the instance refresh fails. You can enable this feature before starting an instance refresh by specifying the `AutoRollback` property in the instance refresh preferences. Otherwise, to roll back an instance refresh before it finishes, use the [RollbackInstanceRefresh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_RollbackInstanceRefresh.html) API.

                The desired configuration. For example, the desired configuration can specify a new launch template or a new version of the current launch template.

                Once the instance refresh succeeds, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling updates the settings of the Auto Scaling group to reflect the new desired configuration.

                When you specify a new launch template or a new version of the current launch template for your desired configuration, consider enabling the `SkipMatching` property in preferences. If it's enabled, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling skips replacing instances that already use the specified launch template and instance types. This can help you reduce the number of replacements that are required to apply updates.

You can also choose to enable additional features, such as the following:

                - Checkpoints

The value must be in quotes (for example, `"30 0 1 1,6,12 *"`). For more information about this format, see [Crontab](http://crontab.org).

                When `StartTime` and `EndTime` are specified with `Recurrence`, they form the boundaries of when the recurring action starts and stops.

                If you specify `Recurrence` and `StartTime`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs the action at this time, and then performs the action based on the specified recurrence.
            time: This property is no longer used.

            Retrieves the forecast data for a predictive scaling policy.

            Load forecasts are predictions of the hourly load values using historical load data from CloudWatch and an analysis of historical trends. Capacity forecasts are represented as predicted values for the minimum capacity that is needed on an hourly basis, based on the hourly load forecast.

            A minimum of 24 hours of data is required to create the initial forecasts. However, having a full 14 days of historical data results in more accurate forecasts.

            **We strongly recommend that all Auto Scaling groups use launch templates to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2.**

            Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group.

            To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the property that you want to change. Any properties that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns.

            If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application.

            Note the following about changing `DesiredCapacity`, `MaxSize`, or `MinSize`:

            - If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new `DesiredCapacity` value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.
            - If you specify a new value for `MinSize` without specifying a value for `DesiredCapacity`, and the new `MinSize` is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's `DesiredCapacity` to the new `MinSize` value.
            - If you specify a new value for `MaxSize` without specifying a value for `DesiredCapacity`, and the new `MaxSize` is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's `DesiredCapacity` to the new `MaxSize` value.

            To see which properties have been set, call the [DescribeAutoScalingGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoScalingGroups.html) API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the [DescribePolicies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribePolicies.html) API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the [PutScalingPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_PutScalingPolicy.html) API.

                The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the `InService` state.

                During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage data. For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, *even if it is set to 0 seconds*. To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify `-1` for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of `0` or other nominal value.
            desired-capacity: The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group after this operation completes and the capacity it attempts to maintain. This number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group.
            desired-capacity-type: |-
                The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports `DesiredCapacityType` for attribute-based instance type selection only.

                By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies `units`, which translates into number of instances.

                Valid values: `units` | `vcpu` | `memory-mib`
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            health-check-grace-period: The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health checks after they enter the `InService` state. For more information, see [Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/health-check-grace-period.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            health-check-type: |-
                A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types.

                The valid values are `EC2`, `EBS`, `ELB`, and `VPC_LATTICE`. `EC2` is the default health check and cannot be disabled. For more information, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Only specify `EC2` if you must clear a value that was previously set.
            instance-lifecycle-policy: The instance lifecycle policy for the Auto Scaling group. Use this to add, modify, or remove lifecycle policies that control instance behavior when an instance transitions through its lifecycle states. Configure retention triggers to specify when to preserve instances for manual intervention.
            instance-maintenance-policy: An instance maintenance policy. For more information, see [Set instance maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            launch-configuration-name: The name of the launch configuration. If you specify `LaunchConfigurationName` in your update request, you can't specify `LaunchTemplate` or `MixedInstancesPolicy`.
            launch-template: The launch template and version to use to specify the updates. If you specify `LaunchTemplate` in your update request, you can't specify `LaunchConfigurationName` or `MixedInstancesPolicy`.
            max-instance-lifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either 0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds (1 day). To clear a previously set value, specify a new value of 0. For more information, see [Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-max-instance-lifetime.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            max-size: |-
                The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.

                With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to go above `MaxSize` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above `MaxSize` by more than your largest instance weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group).
            min-size: The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.
            mixed-instances-policy: The mixed instances policy. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            new-instances-protected-from-scale-in: Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating on scale in, see [Use instance scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                The name of an existing placement group into which to launch your instances. To remove the placement group setting, pass an empty string for `placement-group`. For more information about placement groups, see [Placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                A *cluster* placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. You cannot specify multiple Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.
            service-linked-role-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the Auto Scaling group uses to call other Amazon Web Services on your behalf. For more information, see [Service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-service-linked-role.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            skip-zonal-shift-validation: If you enable zonal shift with cross-zone disabled load balancers, capacity could become imbalanced across Availability Zones. To skip the validation, specify `true`. For more information, see [Auto Scaling group zonal shift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-zonal-shift.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            termination-policies: |-
                A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances to terminate. The policies are executed in the order that you list them. For more information, see [Configure termination policies for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-termination-policies.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            Gets information about the Elastic Load Balancing target groups for the specified Auto Scaling group.

            To determine the attachment status of the target group, use the `State` element in the response. When you attach a target group to an Auto Scaling group, the initial `State` value is `Adding`. The state transitions to `Added` after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the target group. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to `InService` after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the target group is in the `InService` state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the target group doesn't enter the `InService` state.

            Target groups also have an `InService` state if you attach them in the [CreateAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CreateAutoScalingGroup.html) API call. If your target group state is `InService`, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling [DescribeScalingActivities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeScalingActivities.html) and take any corrective actions necessary.

            For help with failed health checks, see [Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ts-as-healthchecks.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*. For more information, see [Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            You can use this operation to describe target groups that were attached by using [AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups.html), but not for target groups that were attached by using [AttachTrafficSources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_AttachTrafficSources.html).

            If the group has instances or scaling activities in progress, you must specify the option to force the deletion in order for it to succeed. The force delete operation will also terminate the EC2 instances. If the group has a warm pool, the force delete option also deletes the warm pool.

            To remove instances from the Auto Scaling group before deleting it, call the [DetachInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DetachInstances.html) API with the list of instances and the option to decrement the desired capacity. This ensures that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not launch replacement instances.

            To terminate all instances before deleting the Auto Scaling group, call the [UpdateAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_UpdateAutoScalingGroup.html) API and set the minimum size and desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to zero.

            If the group has scaling policies, deleting the group deletes the policies, the underlying alarm actions, and any alarm that no longer has an associated action.

            Terminates the specified instance and optionally adjusts the desired group size. This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool.

            This call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not terminated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance status changes to `terminated`. You can't connect to or start an instance after you've terminated it.

            If you do not specify the option to decrement the desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are terminated.

            By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances instances across all Availability Zones. If you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in other zones. For more information, see [Manual scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-manually.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

If you specify a value for `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the difference between the `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` and the desired capacity instead.

                The size of the warm pool is dynamic. Only when `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` and `MinSize` are set to the same value does the warm pool have an absolute size.

                If the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group is higher than the `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`, the capacity of the warm pool is 0, unless you specify a value for `MinSize`. To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value.
            min-size: Specifies the minimum number of instances to maintain in the warm pool. This helps you to ensure that there is always a certain number of warmed instances available to handle traffic spikes. Defaults to 0 if not specified.
            pool-state: Sets the instance state to transition to after the lifecycle actions are complete. Default is `Stopped`.

            Describes the specified tags.

            You can use filters to limit the results. For example, you can query for the tags for a specific Auto Scaling group. You can specify multiple values for a filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values for it to be included in the results.

            You can also specify multiple filters. The result includes information for a particular tag only if it matches all the filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned.

We recommend using `AttachTrafficSources` to simplify how you manage traffic sources. However, we continue to support `AttachLoadBalancers`. You can use both the original `AttachLoadBalancers` API operation and `AttachTrafficSources` on the same Auto Scaling group.

            Attaches one or more Classic Load Balancers to the specified Auto Scaling group. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling registers the running instances with these Classic Load Balancers.

            To describe the load balancers for an Auto Scaling group, call the [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html) API. To detach a load balancer from the Auto Scaling group, call the [DetachLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DetachLoadBalancers.html) API.

            This operation is additive and does not detach existing Classic Load Balancers or target groups from the Auto Scaling group.

            Creates an Auto Scaling group with the specified name and attributes.

            If you exceed your maximum limit of Auto Scaling groups, the call fails. To query this limit, call the [DescribeAccountLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAccountLimits.html) API. For information about updating this limit, see [Quotas for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-quotas.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            If you're new to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, see the introductory tutorials in [Get started with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/get-started-with-ec2-auto-scaling.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            Every Auto Scaling group has three size properties (`DesiredCapacity`, `MaxSize`, and `MinSize`). Usually, you set these sizes based on a specific number of instances. However, if you configure a mixed instances policy that defines weights for the instance types, you must specify these sizes with the same units that you use for weighting instances.
        flag:
            auto-scaling-group-name: |-
                The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account.

                The name can contain any ASCII character 33 to 126 including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

                You cannot use a colon (:) in the name.
            availability-zone-distribution: The instance capacity distribution across Availability Zones.
            availability-zone-impairment-policy: The policy for Availability Zone impairment.
            availability-zones: A list of Availability Zones where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. Used for launching into the default VPC subnet in each Availability Zone when not using the `VPCZoneIdentifier` property, or for attaching a network interface when an existing network interface ID is specified in a launch template.
            capacity-rebalance: Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. Otherwise, Capacity Rebalancing is disabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. For more information, see [Use Capacity Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.html) in the in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see [Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Default: `300` seconds
            default-instance-warmup: |-
                The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the `InService` state.

                During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage data. For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, *even if it is set to 0 seconds*. To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify `-1` for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of `0` or other nominal value.

                Default: None
            desired-capacity: The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group at the time of its creation and the capacity it attempts to maintain. It can scale beyond this capacity if you configure auto scaling. This number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not specify a desired capacity, the default is the minimum size of the group.
            desired-capacity-type: |-
                The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports `DesiredCapacityType` for attribute-based instance type selection only. For more information, see [Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-mixed-instances-group-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies `units`, which translates into number of instances.

                Valid values: `units` | `vcpu` | `memory-mib`
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            health-check-grace-period: |-
                The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health checks after they enter the `InService` state. For more information, see [Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/health-check-grace-period.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Default: `0` seconds
            health-check-type: |-
                A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types.

                The valid values are `EC2`, `EBS`, `ELB`, and `VPC_LATTICE`. `EC2` is the default health check and cannot be disabled. For more information, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Only specify `EC2` if you must clear a value that was previously set.
            instance-id: The ID of the instance used to base the launch configuration on. If specified, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the configuration values from the specified instance to create a new launch configuration. To get the instance ID, use the Amazon EC2 [DescribeInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances.html) API operation. For more information, see [Create an Auto Scaling group using parameters from an existing instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-from-instance.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            instance-lifecycle-policy: |-
                The instance lifecycle policy for the Auto Scaling group. This policy controls instance behavior when an instance transitions through its lifecycle states. Configure retention triggers to specify when instances should move to a `Retained` state for manual intervention instead of automatic termination.

                Instances in a Retained state will continue to incur standard EC2 charges until terminated.
            instance-maintenance-policy: An instance maintenance policy. For more information, see [Set instance maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            launch-configuration-name: |-
                The name of the launch configuration to use to launch instances.

                Conditional: You must specify either a launch template (`LaunchTemplate` or `MixedInstancesPolicy`) or a launch configuration (`LaunchConfigurationName` or `InstanceId`).
            launch-template: |-
                Information used to specify the launch template and version to use to launch instances.

                Conditional: You must specify either a launch template (`LaunchTemplate` or `MixedInstancesPolicy`) or a launch configuration (`LaunchConfigurationName` or `InstanceId`).

                The launch template that is specified must be configured for use with an Auto Scaling group. For more information, see [Create a launch template for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            lifecycle-hook-specification-list: One or more lifecycle hooks to add to the Auto Scaling group before instances are launched.
            load-balancer-names: A list of Classic Load Balancers associated with this Auto Scaling group. For Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers, specify the `TargetGroupARNs` property instead.
            max-instance-lifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either 0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds (1 day). For more information, see [Replace Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-max-instance-lifetime.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            max-size: |-
                The maximum size of the group.

                With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to go above `MaxSize` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above `MaxSize` by more than your largest instance weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group).
            min-size: The minimum size of the group.
            mixed-instances-policy: The mixed instances policy. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            new-instances-protected-from-scale-in: Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating on scale in, see [Use instance scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                The name of the placement group into which to launch your instances. For more information, see [Placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                A *cluster* placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. You cannot specify multiple Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.
            service-linked-role-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the Auto Scaling group uses to call other Amazon Web Services service on your behalf. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling`, which it creates if it does not exist. For more information, see [Service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-service-linked-role.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            skip-zonal-shift-validation: If you enable zonal shift with cross-zone disabled load balancers, capacity could become imbalanced across Availability Zones. To skip the validation, specify `true`. For more information, see [Auto Scaling group zonal shift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-zonal-shift.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            tags: One or more tags. You can tag your Auto Scaling group and propagate the tags to the Amazon EC2 instances it launches. Tags are not propagated to Amazon EBS volumes. To add tags to Amazon EBS volumes, specify the tags in a launch template but use caution. If the launch template specifies an instance tag with a key that is also specified for the Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling overrides the value of that instance tag with the value specified by the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see [Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-tagging.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            target-group-arns: The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target groups to associate with the Auto Scaling group. Instances are registered as targets with the target groups. The target groups receive incoming traffic and route requests to one or more registered targets. For more information, see [Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            Creates or updates a lifecycle hook for the specified Auto Scaling group.

            Lifecycle hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs.

            This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:

            1. (Optional) Create a launch template or launch configuration with a user data script that runs while an instance is in a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.
            2. (Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows Amazon EventBridge to invoke your Lambda function when an instance is put into a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.
            3. (Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.
            4. **Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.**
            5. If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a wait state using the [RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat.html) API call.
            6. If you finish before the timeout period ends, send a callback by using the [CompleteLifecycleAction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CompleteLifecycleAction.html) API call.

            For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            If you exceed your maximum limit of lifecycle hooks, which by default is 50 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.

            You can view the lifecycle hooks for an Auto Scaling group using the [DescribeLifecycleHooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeLifecycleHooks.html) API call. If you are no longer using a lifecycle hook, you can delete it by calling the [DeleteLifecycleHook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DeleteLifecycleHook.html) API.

                - To create a lifecycle hook for scale-in events, specify `autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING`.

                Required for new lifecycle hooks, but optional when updating existing hooks.

                If you specify an empty string, this overrides the current ARN.

                This operation uses the JSON format when sending notifications to an Amazon SQS queue, and an email key-value pair format when sending notifications to an Amazon SNS topic.

                When you specify a notification target, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling sends it a test message. Test messages contain the following additional key-value pair: `"Event": "autoscaling:TEST_NOTIFICATION"`.
            role-arn: |-
                The ARN of the IAM role that allows the Auto Scaling group to publish to the specified notification target.

            This API operation is superseded by [DetachTrafficSources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DetachTrafficSources.html), which can detach multiple traffic sources types. We recommend using `DetachTrafficSources` to simplify how you manage traffic sources. However, we continue to support `DetachLoadBalancers`. You can use both the original `DetachLoadBalancers` API operation and `DetachTrafficSources` on the same Auto Scaling group.

            Detaches one or more Classic Load Balancers from the specified Auto Scaling group.

            This operation detaches only Classic Load Balancers. If you have Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Balancers, use the [DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups.html) API instead.

            When you detach a load balancer, it enters the `Removing` state while deregistering the instances in the group. When all instances are deregistered, then you can no longer describe the load balancer using the [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html) API call. The instances remain running.

            This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:

            1. (Optional) Create a launch template or launch configuration with a user data script that runs while an instance is in a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.
            2. (Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows Amazon EventBridge to invoke your Lambda function when an instance is put into a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.
            3. (Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.
            4. Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.
            5. **If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a wait state.**
            6. If you finish before the timeout period ends, send a callback by using the [CompleteLifecycleAction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CompleteLifecycleAction.html) API call.

            This API operation is superseded by [DescribeTrafficSources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeTrafficSources.html), which can describe multiple traffic sources types. We recommend using `DescribeTrafficSources` to simplify how you manage traffic sources. However, we continue to support `DescribeLoadBalancers`. You can use both the original `DescribeLoadBalancers` API operation and `DescribeTrafficSources` on the same Auto Scaling group.

            Gets information about the load balancers for the specified Auto Scaling group.

            This operation describes only Classic Load Balancers. If you have Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Balancers, use the [DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups.html) API instead.

            To determine the attachment status of the load balancer, use the `State` element in the response. When you attach a load balancer to an Auto Scaling group, the initial `State` value is `Adding`. The state transitions to `Added` after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to `InService` after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the load balancer is in the `InService` state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the load balancer doesn't enter the `InService` state.

            Load balancers also have an `InService` state if you attach them in the [CreateAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CreateAutoScalingGroup.html) API call. If your load balancer state is `InService`, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling [DescribeScalingActivities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeScalingActivities.html) and take any corrective actions necessary.

            For help with failed health checks, see [Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ts-as-healthchecks.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            Cancels an instance refresh that is in progress and rolls back any changes that it made. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces any instances that were replaced during the instance refresh. This restores your Auto Scaling group to the configuration that it was using before the start of the instance refresh.

            This operation is part of the [instance refresh feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html) in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group after you make configuration changes.

            A rollback is not supported in the following situations:

            - There is no desired configuration specified for the instance refresh.
            - The Auto Scaling group has a launch template that uses an Amazon Web Services Systems Manager parameter instead of an AMI ID for the `ImageId` property.
            - The Auto Scaling group uses the launch template's `$Latest` or `$Default` version.

            When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling immediately begins replacing instances. You can check the status of this operation through the [DescribeInstanceRefreshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeInstanceRefreshes.html) API operation.

            Creates a launch configuration.

            If you exceed your maximum limit of launch configurations, the call fails. To query this limit, call the [DescribeAccountLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAccountLimits.html) API. For information about updating this limit, see [Quotas for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-quotas.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            For more information, see [Launch configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-configurations.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling configures instances launched as part of an Auto Scaling group using either a launch template or a launch configuration. We strongly recommend that you do not use launch configurations. They do not provide full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EC2. For information about using launch templates, see [Launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
        flag:
            associate-public-ip-address: |-
                Specifies whether to assign a public IPv4 address to the group's instances. If the instance is launched into a default subnet, the default is to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you disabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet. If the instance is launched into a nondefault subnet, the default is not to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you enabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet.

                If you specify `true`, each instance in the Auto Scaling group receives a unique public IPv4 address. For more information, see [Provide network connectivity for your Auto Scaling instances using Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-in-vpc.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                If you specify this property, you must specify at least one subnet for `VPCZoneIdentifier` when you create your group.
            block-device-mappings: The block device mapping entries that define the block devices to attach to the instances at launch. By default, the block devices specified in the block device mapping for the AMI are used.

            ebs-optimized: |-
                Specifies whether the launch configuration is optimized for EBS I/O (`true`) or not (`false`). The optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization is not available with all instance types. Additional fees are incurred when you enable EBS optimization for an instance type that is not EBS-optimized by default. For more information, see [Amazon EBS-optimized instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that was assigned during registration. For more information, see [Find a Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                If you specify `InstanceId`, an `ImageId` is not required.
            instance-id: |-
                The ID of the instance to use to create the launch configuration. The new launch configuration derives attributes from the instance, except for the block device mapping.

                To create a launch configuration with a block device mapping or override any other instance attributes, specify them as part of the same request.

                For more information, see [Create a launch configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed (`true`) or basic (`false`) monitoring.

                The default value is `true` (enabled).

                When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. For more information, see [Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/enable-as-instance-metrics.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Specifies the instance type of the EC2 instance. For information about available instance types, see [Available instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#AvailableInstanceTypes) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

                If you specify `InstanceId`, an `InstanceType` is not required.
            kernel-id: |-
                The ID of the kernel associated with the AMI.

                We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [User provided kernels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            key-name: The name of the key pair. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 key pairs and Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

            metadata-options: The metadata options for the instances. For more information, see [Configure the instance metadata options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html#launch-configurations-imds) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
            placement-tenancy: |-
                The tenancy of the instance, either `default` or `dedicated`. An instance with `dedicated` tenancy runs on isolated, single-tenant hardware and can only be launched into a VPC. To launch dedicated instances into a shared tenancy VPC (a VPC with the instance placement tenancy attribute set to `default`), you must set the value of this property to `dedicated`.

                If you specify `PlacementTenancy`, you must specify at least one subnet for `VPCZoneIdentifier` when you create your group.

                Valid values: `default` | `dedicated`
            ramdisk-id: |-
                The ID of the RAM disk to select.

                We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [User provided kernels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
            security-groups: A list that contains the security group IDs to assign to the instances in the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see [Control traffic to your Amazon Web Services resources using security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html) in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.
            spot-price: |-
                The maximum hourly price to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot price. For more information, see [Request Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-spot-instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

                Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001

                When you change your maximum price by creating a new launch configuration, running instances will continue to run as long as the maximum price for those running instances is higher than the current Spot price.
            user-data: The user data to make available to the launched EC2 instances. For more information, see [Instance metadata and user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) (Linux) and [Instance metadata and user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) (Windows). If you are using a command line tool, base64-encoding is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise, you must provide base64-encoded text. User data is limited to 16 KB.

        Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

        The [DescribeAutoScalingGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoScalingGroups.html) API operation might be throttled when retrieving details for an Auto Scaling group that contains many instances. By default, this operation returns details for all instances in the group. To help prevent throttling, you can set the `IncludeInstances` parameter to `false` to exclude instance details from the response.

        Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is designed to automatically launch and terminate EC2 instances based on user-defined scaling policies, scheduled actions, and health checks.

        For more information, see the [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) and the [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/Welcome.html).
