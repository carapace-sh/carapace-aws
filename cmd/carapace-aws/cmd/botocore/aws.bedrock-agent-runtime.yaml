            - To continue the same conversation with an agent, use the same `sessionId` value in the request.
            - To activate trace enablement, turn `enableTrace` to `true`. Trace enablement helps you follow the agent's reasoning process that led it to the information it processed, the actions it took, and the final result it yielded. For more information, see [Trace enablement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-test.html#trace-events).
            - End a conversation by setting `endSession` to `true`.
            - In the `sessionState` object, you can include attributes for the session or prompt or, if you configured an action group to return control, results from invocation of the action group.

            The response contains both **chunk** and **trace** attributes.

            The final response is returned in the `bytes` field of the `chunk` object. The `InvokeAgent` returns one chunk for the entire interaction.

            - The `attribution` object contains citations for parts of the response.
            - If you set `enableTrace` to `true` in the request, you can trace the agent's steps and reasoning process that led it to the response.
            - If the action predicted was configured to return control, the response returns parameters for the action, elicited from the user, in the `returnControl` field.
            - Errors are also surfaced in the response.

            Creates a session to temporarily store conversations for generative AI (GenAI) applications built with open-source frameworks such as LangGraph and LlamaIndex. Sessions enable you to save the state of conversations at checkpoints, with the added security and infrastructure of Amazon Web Services. For more information, see [Store and retrieve conversation history and context with Amazon Bedrock sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/sessions.html).

            By default, Amazon Bedrock uses Amazon Web Services-managed keys for session encryption, including session metadata, or you can use your own KMS key. For more information, see [Amazon Bedrock session encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/session-encryption.html).

            You use a session to store state and conversation history for generative AI applications built with open-source frameworks. For Amazon Bedrock Agents, the service automatically manages conversation context and associates them with the agent-specific sessionId you specify in the [InvokeAgent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_InvokeAgent.html) API operation.

                A user interaction remains active for the amount of time specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and the data provided before the timeout is deleted.
            inline-session-state: |-
                Parameters that specify the various attributes of a sessions. You can include attributes for the session or prompt or, if you configured an action group to return control, results from invocation of the action group. For more information, see [Control session context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html).

            input-text: |-
                The prompt text to send to the agent.

            instruction: The instructions that tell the inline agent what it should do and how it should interact with users.
            knowledge-bases: Contains information of the knowledge bases to associate with.
            orchestration-type: Specifies the type of orchestration strategy for the agent. This is set to DEFAULT orchestration type, by default.
            prompt-creation-configurations: Specifies parameters that control how the service populates the agent prompt for an `InvokeInlineAgent` request. You can control which aspects of previous invocations in the same agent session the service uses to populate the agent prompt. This gives you more granular control over the contextual history that is used to process the current request.
            prompt-override-configuration: Configurations for advanced prompts used to override the default prompts to enhance the accuracy of the inline agent.
            session-id: The unique identifier of the session. Use the same value across requests to continue the same conversation.

                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            next-token: If there are more results than can fit in the response, the response returns a `nextToken`. Use this token in the `nextToken` field of another request to retrieve the next batch of results.
            retrieval-configuration: Contains configurations for the knowledge base query and retrieval process. For more information, see [Query configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.html).
            retrieval-query: Contains the query to send the knowledge base.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
