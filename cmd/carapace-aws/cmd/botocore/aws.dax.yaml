            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the DAX cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period. Valid values for `ddd` are:

                Example: `sun:05:00-sun:09:00`

                If you don't specify a preferred maintenance window when you create or modify a cache cluster, DAX assigns a 60-minute maintenance window on a randomly selected day of the week.
            replication-factor: |-
                The number of nodes in the DAX cluster. A replication factor of 1 will create a single-node cluster, without any read replicas. For additional fault tolerance, you can create a multiple node cluster with one or more read replicas. To do this, set `ReplicationFactor` to a number between 3 (one primary and two read replicas) and 10 (one primary and nine read replicas). `If the AvailabilityZones` parameter is provided, its length must equal the `ReplicationFactor`.

                Amazon Web Services recommends that you have at least two read replicas per cluster.
            security-group-ids: |-
                A list of security group IDs to be assigned to each node in the DAX cluster. (Each of the security group ID is system-generated.)

                If this parameter is not specified, DAX assigns the default VPC security group to each node.
            sse-specification: Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption on the cluster.
            subnet-group-name: |-
                The name of the subnet group to be used for the replication group.

                DAX clusters can only run in an Amazon VPC environment. All of the subnets that you specify in a subnet group must exist in the same VPC.
            tags: A set of tags to associate with the DAX cluster.
