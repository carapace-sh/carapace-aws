        flag:
            capabilities: |-
                The capabilities (`audio`, `video`, or `content`) that you want to grant an attendee. If you don't specify capabilities, all users have send and receive capabilities on all media channels by default.

                You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the capabilities can do, such as `SendReceive` data. For more information about those values, see .

                When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

                - If you specify `MeetingFeatures:Video:MaxResolution:None` when you create a meeting, all API requests that include `SendReceive`, `Send`, or `Receive` for `AttendeeCapabilities:Video` will be rejected with `ValidationError 400`.
                - If you specify `MeetingFeatures:Content:MaxResolution:None` when you create a meeting, all API requests that include `SendReceive`, `Send`, or `Receive` for `AttendeeCapabilities:Content` will be rejected with `ValidationError 400`.
                - You can't set `content` capabilities to `SendReceive` or `Receive` unless you also set `video` capabilities to `SendReceive` or `Receive`. If you don't set the `video` capability to receive, the response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you can set your `video` capability to receive and you set your `content` capability to not receive.
                - If meeting features is defined as `Video:MaxResolution:None` but `Content:MaxResolution` is defined as something other than `None` and attendee capabilities are not defined in the API request, then the default attendee video capability is set to `Receive` and attendee content capability is set to `SendReceive`. This is because content `SendReceive` requires video to be at least `Receive`.
                - When you change an `audio` capability from `None` or `Receive` to `Send` or `SendReceive` , and if the attendee left their microphone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting participants.
                - When you change a `video` or `content` capability from `None` or `Receive` to `Send` or `SendReceive` , and if the attendee turned on their video or content streams, remote attendees can receive those streams, but only after media renegotiation between the client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

            By default, Amazon Transcribe may use and store audio content processed by the service to develop and improve Amazon Web Services AI/ML services as further described in section 50 of the [Amazon Web Services Service Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/). Using Amazon Transcribe may be subject to federal and state laws or regulations regarding the recording or interception of electronic communications. It is your and your end users’ responsibility to comply with all applicable laws regarding the recording, including properly notifying all participants in a recorded session or communication that the session or communication is being recorded, and obtaining all necessary consents. You can opt out from Amazon Web Services using audio content to develop and improve AWS AI/ML services by configuring an AI services opt out policy using Amazon Web Services Organizations.

However, you can set your `video` capability to receive and you set your `content` capability to not receive.
            - If meeting features is defined as `Video:MaxResolution:None` but `Content:MaxResolution` is defined as something other than `None` and attendee capabilities are not defined in the API request, then the default attendee video capability is set to `Receive` and attendee content capability is set to `SendReceive`. This is because content `SendReceive` requires video to be at least `Receive`.
            - When you change an `audio` capability from `None` or `Receive` to `Send` or `SendReceive` , and if the attendee left their microphone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting participants.
            - When you change a `video` or `content` capability from `None` or `Receive` to `Send` or `SendReceive` , and if the attendee turned on their video or content streams, remote attendees can receive those streams, but only after media renegotiation between the client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

            - To remove tags from a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for removing tags. For more information, see the documentation for the service whose resource you want to untag.

                Applies one or more tags to an Amazon Chime SDK meeting. Note the following:

                - Not all resources have tags. For a list of services with resources that support tagging using this operation, see [Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html). If the resource doesn't yet support this operation, the resource's service might support tagging using its own API operations. For more information, refer to the documentation for that service.
                - Each resource can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see [Tag Naming and Usage Conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html#tag-conventions) in the *AWS General Reference*.
                - You can only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for the Amazon Web Services account.
                - To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for adding tags. For more information, see the documentation for each service.

                Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. We use tags to provide you with billing and administration services. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.

                **Minimum permissions**

                In addition to the `tag:TagResources` permission required by this operation, you must also have the tagging permission defined by the service that created the resource. For example, to tag a `ChimeSDKMeetings` instance using the `TagResources` operation, you must have both of the following permissions:

                `tag:TagResources`

                `ChimeSDKMeetings:CreateTags`

                Some services might have specific requirements for tagging some resources. For example, to tag an Amazon S3 bucket, you must also have the `s3:GetBucketTagging` permission. If the expected minimum permissions don't work, check the documentation for that service's tagging APIs for more information.
