            Gets a list of runs for a machine learning transform. Machine learning task runs are asynchronous tasks that Glue runs on your behalf as part of various machine learning workflows. You can get a sortable, filterable list of machine learning task runs by calling `GetMLTaskRuns` with their parent transform's `TransformID` and other optional parameters as documented in this section.

            This operation returns a list of historic runs and must be paginated.

            Adds a new version to the existing schema. Returns an error if new version of schema does not meet the compatibility requirements of the schema set. This API will not create a new schema set and will return a 404 error if the schema set is not already present in the Schema Registry.

            If this is the first schema definition to be registered in the Schema Registry, this API will store the schema version and return immediately. Otherwise, this call has the potential to run longer than other operations due to compatibility modes. You can call the `GetSchemaVersion` API with the `SchemaVersionId` to check compatibility modes.

            glue-version: |-
                Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that Glue supports. The Python version indicates the version supported for running your ETL scripts on development endpoints.

                For more information about the available Glue versions and corresponding Spark and Python versions, see [Glue version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html) in the developer guide.

                Development endpoints that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue 0.9.

                You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the `Arguments` parameter in the `CreateDevEndpoint` or `UpdateDevEndpoint` APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
            number-of-nodes: The number of Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) to allocate to this `DevEndpoint`.
            number-of-workers: |-
                The number of workers of a defined `workerType` that are allocated to the development endpoint.

                The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for `G.1X`, and 149 for `G.2X`.
            public-key: The public key to be used by this `DevEndpoint` for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.
            public-keys: |-
                A list of public keys to be used by the development endpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.

                If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys. Call the `UpdateDevEndpoint` API with the public key content in the `deletePublicKeys` attribute, and the list of new keys in the `addPublicKeys` attribute.
            role-arn: The IAM role for the `DevEndpoint`.
            security-configuration: The name of the `SecurityConfiguration` structure to be used with this `DevEndpoint`.
            security-group-ids: Security group IDs for the security groups to be used by the new `DevEndpoint`.
            subnet-id: The subnet ID for the new `DevEndpoint` to use.
            tags: The tags to use with this DevEndpoint. You may use tags to limit access to the DevEndpoint. For more information about tags in Glue, see [Amazon Web Services Tags in Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-tags.html) in the developer guide.
            worker-type: |-
                The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the development endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

                - For the `Standard` worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
                - For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
                - For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.

                Known issue: when a development endpoint is created with the `G.2X` `WorkerType` configuration, the Spark drivers for the development endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB disk.

You typically use `StartExportLabelsTaskRun` when you want to work with all of your existing labels at the same time, such as when you want to remove or change labels that were previously submitted as truth. This API operation accepts the `TransformId` whose labels you want to export and an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path to export the labels to. The operation returns a `TaskRunId`. You can check on the status of your task run by calling the `GetMLTaskRun` API.

                The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to this JobRun. You can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the [Glue pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/).
            arguments: |-
                The job arguments associated with this run. For this job run, they replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself.

                You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

                Job arguments may be logged. Do not pass plaintext secrets as arguments. Retrieve secrets from a Glue Connection, Secrets Manager or other secret management mechanism if you intend to keep them within the Job.

                For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments, see the [Calling Glue APIs in Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html) topic in the developer guide.

            execution-class: |-
                Indicates whether the job is run with a standard or flexible execution class. The standard execution-class is ideal for time-sensitive workloads that require fast job startup and dedicated resources.

                The flexible execution class is appropriate for time-insensitive jobs whose start and completion times may vary.

                Only jobs with Glue version 3.0 and above and command type `glueetl` will be allowed to set `ExecutionClass` to `FLEX`. The flexible execution class is available for Spark jobs.

                Specifies whether job run queuing is enabled for the job run.

                A value of true means job run queuing is enabled for the job run. If false or not populated, the job run will not be considered for queueing.
            max-capacity: |-
                For Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker type, the number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the [Glue pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/).

                For Glue version 2.0+ jobs, you cannot specify a `Maximum capacity`. Instead, you should specify a `Worker type` and the `Number of workers`.

                Do not set `MaxCapacity` if using `WorkerType` and `NumberOfWorkers`.

                The value that can be allocated for `MaxCapacity` depends on whether you are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an Apache Spark streaming ETL job:

                - When you specify a Python shell job (`JobCommand.Name`="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.
                - When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="glueetl") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="gluestreaming"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.
            notification-property: Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.
            number-of-workers: The number of workers of a defined `workerType` that are allocated when a job runs.
            security-configuration: The name of the `SecurityConfiguration` structure to be used with this job run.
            timeout: |-
                The `JobRun` timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters `TIMEOUT` status. This value overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

                Jobs must have timeout values less than 7 days or 10080 minutes. Otherwise, the jobs will throw an exception.

                When the value is left blank, the timeout is defaulted to 2880 minutes.

                Any existing Glue jobs that had a timeout value greater than 7 days will be defaulted to 7 days. For instance if you have specified a timeout of 20 days for a batch job, it will be stopped on the 7th day.

                For streaming jobs, if you have set up a maintenance window, it will be restarted during the maintenance window after 7 days.
            worker-type: |-
                The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts a value of G.1X, G.2X, G.4X, G.8X or G.025X for Spark jobs. Accepts the value Z.2X for Ray jobs.

                - For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16 GB of memory) with 94GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
                - For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB of memory) with 138GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
                - For the `G.4X` worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).
                - For the `G.8X` worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the same Amazon Web Services Regions as supported for the `G.4X` worker type.
                - For the `G.025X` worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPUs, 4 GB of memory) with 84GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This worker type is only available for Glue version 3.0 or later streaming jobs.
                - For the `Z.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 128 GB disk, and provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.

            expression: |-
                An expression that filters the partitions to be returned.

                The expression uses SQL syntax similar to the SQL `WHERE` filter clause. The SQL statement parser [JSQLParser](http://jsqlparser.sourceforge.net/home.php) parses the expression.

                *Operators*: The following are the operators that you can use in the `Expression` API call:

                =

                Checks whether the values of the two operands are equal; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20.

                (a = b) is not true.

                &lt; &gt;

                Checks whether the values of two operands are equal; if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &lt; &gt; b) is true.

                &gt;

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &gt; b) is not true.

                &lt;

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &lt; b) is true.

                &gt;=

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &gt;= b) is not true.

                &lt;=

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &lt;= b) is true.

                AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL

                Logical operators.

                *Supported Partition Key Types*: The following are the supported partition keys.

                - `string`
                - `date`
                - `timestamp`
                - `int`
                - `bigint`
                - `long`
                - `tinyint`
                - `smallint`
                - `decimal`

                If an type is encountered that is not valid, an exception is thrown.

                The following list shows the valid operators on each type. When you define a crawler, the `partitionKey` type is created as a `STRING`, to be compatible with the catalog partitions.

            Remove versions from the specified schema. A version number or range may be supplied. If the compatibility mode forbids deleting of a version that is necessary, such as BACKWARDS\_FULL, an error is returned. Calling the `GetSchemaVersions` API after this call will list the status of the deleted versions.

            When the range of version numbers contain check pointed version, the API will return a 409 conflict and will not proceed with the deletion. You have to remove the checkpoint first using the `DeleteSchemaCheckpoint` API before using this API.

            You cannot use the `DeleteSchemaVersions` API to delete the first schema version in the schema set. The first schema version can only be deleted by the `DeleteSchema` API. This operation will also delete the attached `SchemaVersionMetadata` under the schema versions. Hard deletes will be enforced on the database.

                Indicates the level of filtering a third-party analytical engine is capable of enforcing when calling the `GetUnfilteredTableMetadata` API operation. Accepted values are:

                - `COLUMN_PERMISSION` - Column permissions ensure that users can access only specific columns in the table. If there are particular columns contain sensitive data, data lake administrators can define column filters that exclude access to specific columns.
                - `CELL_FILTER_PERMISSION` - Cell-level filtering combines column filtering (include or exclude columns) and row filter expressions to restrict access to individual elements in the table.
                - `NESTED_PERMISSION` - Nested permissions combines cell-level filtering and nested column filtering to restrict access to columns and/or nested columns in specific rows based on row filter expressions.
                - `NESTED_CELL_PERMISSION` - Nested cell permissions combines nested permission with nested cell-level filtering. This allows different subsets of nested columns to be restricted based on an array of row filter expressions.

                Note: Each of these permission types follows a hierarchical order where each subsequent permission type includes all permission of the previous type.

                Important: If you provide a supported permission type that doesn't match the user's level of permissions on the table, then Lake Formation raises an exception. For example, if the third-party engine calling the `GetUnfilteredTableMetadata` operation can enforce only column-level filtering, and the user has nested cell filtering applied on the table, Lake Formation throws an exception, and will not return unfiltered table metadata and data access credentials.

            Enables you to provide additional labels (examples of truth) to be used to teach the machine learning transform and improve its quality. This API operation is generally used as part of the active learning workflow that starts with the `StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun` call and that ultimately results in improving the quality of your machine learning transform.

            After the `StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun` finishes, Glue machine learning will have generated a series of questions for humans to answer. (Answering these questions is often called 'labeling' in the machine learning workflows). In the case of the `FindMatches` transform, these questions are of the form, “What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?” After the labeling process is finished, users upload their answers/labels with a call to `StartImportLabelsTaskRun`. After `StartImportLabelsTaskRun` finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform use the new and improved labels and perform a higher-quality transformation.

            By default, `StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun` continually learns from and combines all labels that you upload unless you set `Replace` to true. If you set `Replace` to true, `StartImportLabelsTaskRun` deletes and forgets all previously uploaded labels and learns only from the exact set that you upload. Replacing labels can be helpful if you realize that you previously uploaded incorrect labels, and you believe that they are having a negative effect on your transform quality.

            You can check on the status of your task run by calling the `GetMLTaskRun` operation.

                - For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16 GB of memory) with 94GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
                - For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB of memory) with 138GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
                - For the `G.4X` worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).
                - For the `G.8X` worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the same Amazon Web Services Regions as supported for the `G.4X` worker type.
                - For the `Z.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 128 GB disk, and provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.

            expression: |-
                An expression that filters the partitions to be returned.

                The expression uses SQL syntax similar to the SQL `WHERE` filter clause. The SQL statement parser [JSQLParser](http://jsqlparser.sourceforge.net/home.php) parses the expression.

                *Operators*: The following are the operators that you can use in the `Expression` API call:

                =

                Checks whether the values of the two operands are equal; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20.

                (a = b) is not true.

                &lt; &gt;

                Checks whether the values of two operands are equal; if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &lt; &gt; b) is true.

                &gt;

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &gt; b) is not true.

                &lt;

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &lt; b) is true.

                &gt;=

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &gt;= b) is not true.

                &lt;=

                Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

                Example: (a &lt;= b) is true.

                AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL

                Logical operators.

                *Supported Partition Key Types*: The following are the supported partition keys.

                - `string`
                - `date`
                - `timestamp`

                - `tinyint`
                - `smallint`
                - `decimal`

                If an type is encountered that is not valid, an exception is thrown.

            Starts the active learning workflow for your machine learning transform to improve the transform's quality by generating label sets and adding labels.

            When the `StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun` finishes, Glue will have generated a "labeling set" or a set of questions for humans to answer.

            In the case of the `FindMatches` transform, these questions are of the form, “What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?”

            After the labeling process is finished, you can upload your labels with a call to `StartImportLabelsTaskRun`. After `StartImportLabelsTaskRun` finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform will use the new and improved labels and perform a higher-quality transformation.

            Note: The role used to write the generated labeling set to the `OutputS3Path` is the role associated with the Machine Learning Transform, specified in the `CreateMLTransform` API.

            Removes a specified database from a Data Catalog.

            After completing this operation, you no longer have access to the tables (and all table versions and partitions that might belong to the tables) and the user-defined functions in the deleted database. Glue deletes these "orphaned" resources asynchronously in a timely manner, at the discretion of the service.

            To ensure the immediate deletion of all related resources, before calling `DeleteDatabase`, use `DeleteTableVersion` or `BatchDeleteTableVersion`, `DeletePartition` or `BatchDeletePartition`, `DeleteUserDefinedFunction`, and `DeleteTable` or `BatchDeleteTable`, to delete any resources that belong to the database.

Also, when comparing string values, such as when `Key=Name`, a fuzzy match algorithm is used. The `Key` field (for example, the value of the `Name` field) is split on certain punctuation characters, for example, -, :, #, etc. into tokens. Then each token is exact-match compared with the `Value` member of `PropertyPredicate`. For example, if `Key=Name` and `Value=link`, tables named `customer-link` and `xx-link-yy` are returned, but `xxlinkyy` is not returned.

                For Glue version 2.0+ jobs, you cannot specify a `Maximum capacity`. Instead, you should specify a `Worker type` and the `Number of workers`.

                Do not set `MaxCapacity` if using `WorkerType` and `NumberOfWorkers`.

                The value that can be allocated for `MaxCapacity` depends on whether you are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an Apache Spark streaming ETL job:

                - When you specify a Python shell job (`JobCommand.Name`="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.
                - When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="glueetl") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="gluestreaming"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.
            max-retries: The maximum number of times to retry this job if it fails.
            name: The name you assign to this job definition. It must be unique in your account.
            non-overridable-arguments: Arguments for this job that are not overridden when providing job arguments in a job run, specified as name-value pairs.
            notification-property: Specifies configuration properties of a job notification.
            number-of-workers: The number of workers of a defined `workerType` that are allocated when a job runs.
            role: The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with this job.
            security-configuration: The name of the `SecurityConfiguration` structure to be used with this job.
            source-control-details: The details for a source control configuration for a job, allowing synchronization of job artifacts to or from a remote repository.
            tags: The tags to use with this job. You may use tags to limit access to the job. For more information about tags in Glue, see [Amazon Web Services Tags in Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-tags.html) in the developer guide.
            timeout: |-
                The job timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters `TIMEOUT` status.

                Jobs must have timeout values less than 7 days or 10080 minutes. Otherwise, the jobs will throw an exception.

                When the value is left blank, the timeout is defaulted to 2880 minutes.

                Any existing Glue jobs that had a timeout value greater than 7 days will be defaulted to 7 days. For instance if you have specified a timeout of 20 days for a batch job, it will be stopped on the 7th day.

                For streaming jobs, if you have set up a maintenance window, it will be restarted during the maintenance window after 7 days.
            worker-type: |-
                The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts a value of G.1X, G.2X, G.4X, G.8X or G.025X for Spark jobs. Accepts the value Z.2X for Ray jobs.

                - For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16 GB of memory) with 94GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
                - For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB of memory) with 138GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs.
                - For the `G.4X` worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Spain), Europe (Stockholm), and South America (São Paulo).
                - For the `G.8X` worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the same Amazon Web Services Regions as supported for the `G.4X` worker type.
                - For the `G.025X` worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPUs, 4 GB of memory) with 84GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This worker type is only available for Glue version 3.0 or later streaming jobs.
                - For the `Z.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 128 GB disk, and provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.
