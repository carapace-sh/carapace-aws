            Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch version of `ChangeMessageVisibility.` The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. You can send up to 10 `ChangeMessageVisibility` requests with each `ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch` action.

            Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of `200`.

      documentation:
        command: "Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:\n\n- If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue.\n  \n  You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see [Moving From a standard queue to a FIFO queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-moving) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n- If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute.\n- If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.\n\nTo successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the [limits related to queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-queues.html) and is unique within the scope of your queues.\n\nAfter you create a queue, you must wait at least one second after the queue is created to be able to use the queue.\n\nTo retrieve the URL of a queue, use the [`GetQueueUrl`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueueUrl.html) action. This action only requires the [`QueueName`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_CreateQueue.html#API_CreateQueue_RequestSyntax) parameter.\n\nWhen creating queues, keep the following points in mind:\n\n- If you specify the name of an existing queue and provide the exact same names and values for all its attributes, the [`CreateQueue`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_CreateQueue.html) action will return the URL of the existing queue instead of creating a new one.\n- If you attempt to create a queue with a name that already exists but with different attribute names or values, the `CreateQueue` action will return an error. This ensures that existing queues are not inadvertently altered.\n\nCross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see [Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a username](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."
        flag:
            attributes: "A map of attributes with their corresponding values.\n\nThe following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the `CreateQueue` action uses:\n\n- `DelaySeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.\n- `MaximumMessageSize` – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 1,048,576 bytes (1 MiB). Default: 1,048,576 bytes (1 MiB).\n- `MessageRetentionPeriod` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the `MessageRetentionPeriod` attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the `MessageRetentionPeriod` is reduced below the age of existing messages.\n- `Policy` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see [Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.\n- `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which a `ReceiveMessage` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.\n- `VisibilityTimeout` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see [Visibility Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [dead-letter queues:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html)\n\n- `RedrivePolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:\n  \n  - `deadLetterTargetArn` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.\n  - `maxReceiveCount` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the `maxReceiveCount` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.\n- `RedriveAllowPolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:\n  \n  - `redrivePermission` – The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:\n    \n    - `allowAll` – (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n    - `denyAll` – No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n    - `byQueue` – Only queues specified by the `sourceQueueArns` parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n  - `sourceQueueArns` – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the `redrivePermission` parameter is set to `byQueue`. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the `redrivePermission` parameter to `allowAll`.\n\nThe dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html):\n\n- `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms). While the alias of the Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always `alias/aws/sqs`, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be `alias/MyAlias`. For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the *Key Management Service API Reference*.\n- `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys) to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see [How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work)\n- `SqsManagedSseEnabled` – Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, [SSE-KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-sse-existing-queue.html) or [SSE-SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-sqs-sse-queue.html)).\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html):\n\n- `FifoQueue` – Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are `true` and `false`. If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the `MessageGroupId` for your messages explicitly.\n  \n  For more information, see [FIFO queue logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-understanding-logic.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n- `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication. Valid values are `true` and `false`. For more information, see [Exactly-once processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*. Note the following:\n  \n  - Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`.\n    \n    - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.\n    - If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).\n    - If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails with an error.\n    - If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.\n  - When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n  - If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is the same as the one generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [high throughput for FIFO queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html):\n\n- `DeduplicationScope` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are `messageGroup` and `queue`.\n- `FifoThroughputLimit` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are `perQueue` and `perMessageGroupId`. The `perMessageGroupId` value is allowed only when the value for `DeduplicationScope` is `messageGroup`.\n\nTo enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:\n\n- Set `DeduplicationScope` to `messageGroup`.\n- Set `FifoThroughputLimit` to `perMessageGroupId`.\n\nIf you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.\n\nFor information on throughput quotas, see [Quotas related to messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."

            tags: |-
                Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview, see [Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

                When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

                - Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.
                - Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings.
                - Tags are case-sensitive.
                - A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.

                For a full list of tag restrictions, see [Quotas related to queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html#limits-queues) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

                To be able to tag a queue on creation, you must have the `sqs:CreateQueue` and `sqs:TagQueue` permissions.

                Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.

        command: |-
            Retrieves one or more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue. Using the `WaitTimeSeconds` parameter enables long-poll support. For more information, see [Amazon SQS Long Polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

            Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a `ReceiveMessage` call. Therefore, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per `ReceiveMessage` call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular `ReceiveMessage` response. If this happens, repeat the request.

            For each message returned, the response includes the following:

            - The message body.
            - An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see [RFC1321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt).
            - The `MessageId` you received when you sent the message to the queue.
            - The receipt handle.
            - The message attributes.
            - An MD5 digest of the message attributes.

            The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see [Queue and Message Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

            You can provide the `VisibilityTimeout` parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. The default visibility timeout for a queue is 30 seconds.

            In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see [Visibility Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n  \n  If a caller of the `ReceiveMessage` action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error.\n  \n  To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary.\n- While messages with a particular `MessageGroupId` are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same `MessageGroupId` are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another `MessageGroupId` from your FIFO queue as long as they are visible.\n- If a caller of `ReceiveMessage` can't track the `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order.\n\nThe maximum length of `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` is 128 characters. `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` can contain alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and punctuation (``!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~``).\n\nFor best practices of using `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, see [Using the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-receiverequestattemptid-request-parameter.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."
            visibility-timeout: |-
                The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a `ReceiveMessage` request. If not specified, the default visibility timeout for the queue is used, which is 30 seconds.

                Understanding `VisibilityTimeout`:

                - When a message is received from a queue, it becomes temporarily invisible to other consumers for the duration of the visibility timeout. This prevents multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously. If the message is not deleted or its visibility timeout is not extended before the timeout expires, it becomes visible again and can be retrieved by other consumers.
                - Setting an appropriate visibility timeout is crucial. If it's too short, the message might become visible again before processing is complete, leading to duplicate processing. If it's too long, it delays the reprocessing of messages if the initial processing fails.
                - You can adjust the visibility timeout using the `--visibility-timeout` parameter in the `receive-message` command to match the processing time required by your application.
                - A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.

                For more information, see [Visibility Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.
            wait-time-seconds: |-
                The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns sooner than `WaitTimeSeconds`. If no messages are available and the wait time expires, the call does not return a message list. If you are using the Java SDK, it returns a `ReceiveMessageResponse` object, which has a empty list instead of a Null object.

                To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for `ReceiveMessage` requests is longer than the `WaitTimeSeconds` parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP transport settings using the [NettyNioAsyncHttpClient](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.html) for asynchronous clients, or the [ApacheHttpClient](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/apache/ApacheHttpClient.html) for synchronous clients.

            You can use `SendMessageBatch` to send up to 10 messages to the specified queue by assigning either identical or different values to each message (or by not assigning values at all). This is a batch version of `SendMessage.` For a FIFO queue, multiple messages within a single batch are enqueued in the order they are sent.

            The result of sending each message is reported individually in the response. Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of `200`.

            The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 1 MiB 1,048,576 bytes.

            A message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed. For more information, see the [W3C specification for characters](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets).

            `#x9` | `#xA` | `#xD` | `#x20` to `#xD7FF` | `#xE000` to `#xFFFD` | `#x10000` to `#x10FFFF`

            If a message contains characters outside the allowed set, Amazon SQS rejects the message and returns an InvalidMessageContents error. Ensure that your message body includes only valid characters to avoid this exception.

            If you don't specify the `DelaySeconds` parameter for an entry, Amazon SQS uses the default value for the queue.

                `#x9` | `#xA` | `#xD` | `#x20` to `#xD7FF` | `#xE000` to `#xFFFD` | `#x10000` to `#x10FFFF`

                If a message contains characters outside the allowed set, Amazon SQS rejects the message and returns an InvalidMessageContents error. Ensure that your message body includes only valid characters to avoid this exception.
            message-deduplication-id: "This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.\n\nThe token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a particular `MessageDeduplicationId` is sent successfully, any messages sent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered during the 5-minute deduplication interval. For more information, see [Exactly-once processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n\n- Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`,\n  \n  - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.\n  - If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).\n  - If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails with an error.\n  - If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.\n- When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n- If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is the same as the one generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n\nThe `MessageDeduplicationId` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).\n\nIf a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.\n\nAmazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.\n\nThe maximum length of `MessageDeduplicationId` is 128 characters. `MessageDeduplicationId` can contain alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and punctuation (``!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~``).\n\nFor best practices of using `MessageDeduplicationId`, see [Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."
            message-group-id: "`MessageGroupId` is an attribute used in Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and standard queues. In FIFO queues, `MessageGroupId` organizes messages into distinct groups. Messages within the same message group are always processed one at a time, in strict order, ensuring that no two messages from the same group are processed simultaneously. In standard queues, using `MessageGroupId` enables fair queues. It is used to identify the tenant a message belongs to, helping maintain consistent message dwell time across all tenants during noisy neighbor events. Unlike FIFO queues, messages with the same `MessageGroupId` can be processed in parallel, maintaining the high throughput of standard queues.\n\n- **FIFO queues:** `MessageGroupId` acts as the tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use `MessageGroupId` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.\n  \n  If you do not provide a `MessageGroupId` when sending a message to a FIFO queue, the action fails.\n  \n  `ReceiveMessage` might return messages with multiple `MessageGroupId` values. For each `MessageGroupId`, the messages are sorted by time sent.\n- **Standard queues:**Use `MessageGroupId` in standard queues to enable fair queues. The `MessageGroupId` identifies the tenant a message belongs to. A tenant can be any entity that shares a queue with others, such as your customer, a client application, or a request type. When one tenant sends a disproportionately large volume of messages or has messages that require longer processing time, fair queues ensure other tenants' messages maintain low dwell time. This preserves quality of service for all tenants while maintaining the scalability and throughput of standard queues. We recommend that you include a `MessageGroupId` in all messages when using fair queues.\n\nThe length of `MessageGroupId` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~)``.\n\nFor best practices of using `MessageGroupId`, see [Using the MessageGroupId Property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."

            Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see [Visibility Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

            For example, if the default timeout for a queue is 60 seconds, 15 seconds have elapsed since you received the message, and you send a ChangeMessageVisibility call with `VisibilityTimeout` set to 10 seconds, the 10 seconds begin to count from the time that you make the `ChangeMessageVisibility` call. Thus, any attempt to change the visibility timeout or to delete that message 10 seconds after you initially change the visibility timeout (a total of 25 seconds) might result in an error.

            An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:

            1. Sent to a queue by a producer.
            2. Received from the queue by a consumer.
            3. Deleted from the queue.

            A message is considered to be *stored* after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be *in flight* after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of in flight messages.

            Limits that apply to in flight messages are unrelated to the *unlimited* number of stored messages.

            For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the `OverLimit` error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, [file a support request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sqs).

            For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 120,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.

            If you attempt to set the `VisibilityTimeout` to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.

            Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the `ChangeMessageVisibility` action) the next time the message is received.

The `perMessageGroupId` value is allowed only when the value for `DeduplicationScope` is `messageGroup`.\n\nTo enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:\n\n- Set `DeduplicationScope` to `messageGroup`.\n- Set `FifoThroughputLimit` to `perMessageGroupId`.\n\nIf you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.\n\nFor information on throughput quotas, see [Quotas related to messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."

            When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

            - Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.
            - Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings.
            - Tags are case-sensitive.
            - A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.

            Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the `ReceiptHandle` of the message (*not* the `MessageId` which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue.

            Each time you receive a message, meaning when a consumer retrieves a message from the queue, it comes with a unique `ReceiptHandle`. If you receive the same message more than once, you will get a different `ReceiptHandle` each time. When you want to delete a message using the `DeleteMessage` action, you must use the `ReceiptHandle` from the most recent time you received the message. If you use an old `ReceiptHandle`, the request will succeed, but the message might not be deleted.

            For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

            Sets the value of one or more queue attributes, like a policy. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the `MessageRetentionPeriod` attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the `MessageRetentionPeriod` is reduced below the age of existing messages.

            - In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

            attributes: "A map of attributes to set.\n\nThe following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the `SetQueueAttributes` action uses:\n\n- `DelaySeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.\n- `MaximumMessageSize` – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 1,048,576 bytes (1 MiB). Default: 1,048,576 bytes (1 MiB).\n- `MessageRetentionPeriod` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the `MessageRetentionPeriod` attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the `MessageRetentionPeriod` is reduced below the age of existing messages.\n- `Policy` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see [Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.\n- `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which a `ReceiveMessage` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.\n- `VisibilityTimeout` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see [Visibility Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [dead-letter queues:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html)\n\n- `RedrivePolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:\n  \n  - `deadLetterTargetArn` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.\n  - `maxReceiveCount` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the `maxReceiveCount` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.\n- `RedriveAllowPolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:\n  \n  - `redrivePermission` – The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:\n    \n    - `allowAll` – (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n    - `denyAll` – No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n    - `byQueue` – Only queues specified by the `sourceQueueArns` parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n  - `sourceQueueArns` – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the `redrivePermission` parameter is set to `byQueue`. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the `redrivePermission` parameter to `allowAll`.\n\nThe dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html):\n\n- `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms). While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always `alias/aws/sqs`, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be `alias/MyAlias`. For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the *Key Management Service API Reference*.\n- `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys) to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see [How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work).\n- `SqsManagedSseEnabled` – Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, [SSE-KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-sse-existing-queue.html) or [SSE-SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-sqs-sse-queue.html)).\n\nThe following attribute applies only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html):\n\n- `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication. For more information, see [Exactly-once processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*. Note the following:\n  \n  - Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`.\n    \n    - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.\n    - If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).\n    - If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails with an error.\n    - If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.\n  - When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n  - If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is the same as the one generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.\n\nThe following attributes apply only to [high throughput for FIFO queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html):\n\n- `DeduplicationScope` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are `messageGroup` and `queue`.\n- `FifoThroughputLimit` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are `perQueue` and `perMessageGroupId`. The `perMessageGroupId` value is allowed only when the value for `DeduplicationScope` is `messageGroup`.\n\nTo enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:\n\n- Set `DeduplicationScope` to `messageGroup`.\n- Set `FifoThroughputLimit` to `perMessageGroupId`.\n\nIf you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.\n\nFor information on throughput quotas, see [Quotas related to messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html) in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*."
