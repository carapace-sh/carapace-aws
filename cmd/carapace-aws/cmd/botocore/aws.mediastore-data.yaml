            path: |-
                The path (including the file name) where the object is stored in the container. Format: &lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;

                For example, to upload the file `mlaw.avi` to the folder path `premium\canada` in the container `movies`, enter the path `premium/canada/mlaw.avi`.

                Do not include the container name in this path.

                If the path includes any folders that don't exist yet, the service creates them. For example, suppose you have an existing `premium/usa` subfolder. If you specify `premium/canada`, the service creates a `canada` subfolder in the `premium` folder. You then have two subfolders, `usa` and `canada`, in the `premium` folder.

                There is no correlation between the path to the source and the path (folders) in the container in AWS Elemental MediaStore.

                For more information about folders and how they exist in a container, see the [AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/).

                The file name is the name that is assigned to the file that you upload. The file can have the same name inside and outside of AWS Elemental MediaStore, or it can have the same name. The file name can include or omit an extension.
            range: The range bytes of an object to retrieve. For more information about the `Range` header, see [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35). AWS Elemental MediaStore ignores this header for partially uploaded objects that have streaming upload availability.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results to return per API request. For example, you submit a `ListItems` request with `MaxResults` set at 500. Although 2,000 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 500 items. (The service also returns a `NextToken` value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.) The service might return fewer results than the `MaxResults` value.

                If `MaxResults` is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 1,000 results per page.
            next-token: |-
                The token that identifies which batch of results that you want to see. For example, you submit a `ListItems` request with `MaxResults` set at 500. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 500) and a `NextToken` value. To see the next batch of results, you can submit the `ListItems` request a second time and specify the `NextToken` value.

                Tokens expire after 15 minutes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            path: 'The path in the container from which to retrieve items. Format: &lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;'
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            path: |-
                The path (including the file name) where the object is stored in the container. Format: &lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;file name&gt;

                For example, to upload the file `mlaw.avi` to the folder path `premium\canada` in the container `movies`, enter the path `premium/canada/mlaw.avi`.

                Do not include the container name in this path.

                If the path includes any folders that don't exist yet, the service creates them. For example, suppose you have an existing `premium/usa` subfolder. If you specify `premium/canada`, the service creates a `canada` subfolder in the `premium` folder. You then have two subfolders, `usa` and `canada`, in the `premium` folder.

                There is no correlation between the path to the source and the path (folders) in the container in AWS Elemental MediaStore.

                For more information about folders and how they exist in a container, see the [AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/).

                The file name is the name that is assigned to the file that you upload. The file can have the same name inside and outside of AWS Elemental MediaStore, or it can have the same name. The file name can include or omit an extension.
            storage-class: Indicates the storage class of a `Put` request. Defaults to high-performance temporal storage class, and objects are persisted into durable storage shortly after being received.
            upload-availability: |-
                Indicates the availability of an object while it is still uploading. If the value is set to `streaming`, the object is available for downloading after some initial buffering but before the object is uploaded completely. If the value is set to `standard`, the object is available for downloading only when it is uploaded completely. The default value for this header is `standard`.

                To use this header, you must also set the HTTP `Transfer-Encoding` header to `chunked`.
