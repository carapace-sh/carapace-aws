If `false`, then a list of profiling group names is returned.
            max-results: The maximum number of profiling groups results returned by `ListProfilingGroups` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListProfilingGroups` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListProfilingGroups` request with the returned `nextToken` value.

                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListProfilingGroups` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

                The requested resolution of time steps for the returned time series of values. If the requested target resolution is not available due to data not being retained we provide a best effort result by falling back to the most granular available resolution after the target resolution. There are 3 valid values.

                - `P1D` — 1 day
                - `PT1H` — 1 hour
                - `PT5M` — 5 minutes

      description: Used by profiler agents to report their current state and to receive remote configuration updates.
      flags:
        --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided.
        --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided.
        --fleet-instance-id=: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for a profiling instance.
        --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.
        --metadata=: Metadata captured about the compute platform the agent is running on.
        --profiling-group-name=!: The name of the profiling group for which the configured agent is collecting profiling data.

        command: Used by profiler agents to report their current state and to receive remote configuration updates. For example, `ConfigureAgent` can be used to tell an agent whether to profile or not and for how long to return profiling data.
        flag:
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            fleet-instance-id: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for a profiling instance. For example, if the profiling instance is an Amazon EC2 instance, it is the instance ID. If it is an AWS Fargate container, it is the container's task ID.

            metadata: |-
                Metadata captured about the compute platform the agent is running on. It includes information about sampling and reporting. The valid fields are:

                - `COMPUTE_PLATFORM` - The compute platform on which the agent is running
                - `AGENT_ID` - The ID for an agent instance.
                - `AWS_REQUEST_ID` - The AWS request ID of a Lambda invocation.
                - `EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT` - The execution environment a Lambda function is running on.
                - `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is used to invoke a Lambda function.
                - `LAMBDA_MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_MB` - The memory allocated to a Lambda function.
                - `LAMBDA_REMAINING_TIME_IN_MILLISECONDS` - The time in milliseconds before execution of a Lambda function times out.
                - `LAMBDA_TIME_GAP_BETWEEN_INVOKES_IN_MILLISECONDS` - The time in milliseconds between two invocations of a Lambda function.
                - `LAMBDA_PREVIOUS_EXECUTION_TIME_IN_MILLISECONDS` - The time in milliseconds for the previous Lambda invocation.
            profiling-group-name: The name of the profiling group for which the configured agent is collecting profiling data.

        This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API operations.

        Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live applications, and provides recommendations that can help you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine learning algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.

        Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code is running on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.

        Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in all Java virtual machine (JVM) languages and Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports both visualizations and recommendations for applications written in Java, it can also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for applications written in other JVM languages and Python.

        For more information, see [What is Amazon CodeGuru Profiler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-ug/what-is-codeguru-profiler.html) in the *Amazon CodeGuru Profiler User Guide*.
