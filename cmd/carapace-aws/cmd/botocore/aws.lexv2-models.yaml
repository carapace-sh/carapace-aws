            To use this API operation, your IAM role must have permissions to perform the [ListAggregatedUtterances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/APIReference/API_ListAggregatedUtterances.html) operation, which provides access to utterance-related analytics. See [Viewing utterance statistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/monitoring-utterances.html) for the IAM policy to apply to the IAM role.

            Retrieves summary metrics for the utterances in your bot. The following fields are required:

            - `metrics` – A list of [AnalyticsUtteranceMetric](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/APIReference/API_AnalyticsUtteranceMetric.html) objects. In each object, use the `name` field to specify the metric to calculate, the `statistic` field to specify whether to calculate the `Sum`, `Average`, or `Max` number, and the `order` field to specify whether to sort the results in `Ascending` or `Descending` order.
            - `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` – Define a time range for which you want to retrieve results.

            Of the optional fields, you can organize the results in the following ways:

            - Use the `filters` field to filter the results, the `groupBy` field to specify categories by which to group the results, and the `binBy` field to specify time intervals by which to group the results.
            - Use the `maxResults` field to limit the number of results to return in a single response and the `nextToken` field to return the next batch of results if the response does not return the full set of results.

            Note that an `order` field exists in both `binBy` and `metrics`. Currently, you can specify it in either field, but not in both.

In each object, use the `name` field to specify the metric to calculate, the `statistic` field to specify whether to calculate the `Sum`, `Average`, or `Max` number, and the `order` field to specify whether to sort the results in `Ascending` or `Descending` order.
            - `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` – Define a time range for which you want to retrieve results.

            Of the optional fields, you can organize the results in the following ways:

            - Use the `filters` field to filter the results, the `groupBy` field to specify categories by which to group the results, and the `binBy` field to specify time intervals by which to group the results.
            - Use the `maxResults` field to limit the number of results to return in a single response and the `nextToken` field to return the next batch of results if the response does not return the full set of results.

            Note that an `order` field exists in both `binBy` and `metrics`. You can only specify one `order` in a given request.

            Creates an intent.

            To define the interaction between the user and your bot, you define one or more intents. For example, for a pizza ordering bot you would create an `OrderPizza` intent.

            When you create an intent, you must provide a name. You can optionally provide the following:

            - Sample utterances. For example, "I want to order a pizza" and "Can I order a pizza." You can't provide utterances for built-in intents.
            - Information to be gathered. You specify slots for the information that you bot requests from the user. You can specify standard slot types, such as date and time, or custom slot types for your application.
            - How the intent is fulfilled. You can provide a Lambda function or configure the intent to return the intent information to your client application. If you use a Lambda function, Amazon Lex invokes the function when all of the intent information is available.
            - A confirmation prompt to send to the user to confirm an intent. For example, "Shall I order your pizza?"
            - A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent is fulfilled. For example, "I ordered your pizza."
            - A follow-up prompt that asks the user for additional activity. For example, "Do you want a drink with your pizza?"
        flag:
            bot-id: The identifier of the bot associated with this intent.

                Specifies that Amazon Lex invokes the alias Lambda function for each user input. You can invoke this Lambda function to personalize user interaction.

                For example, suppose that your bot determines that the user's name is John. You Lambda function might retrieve John's information from a backend database and prepopulate some of the values. For example, if you find that John is gluten intolerant, you might set the corresponding intent slot, `glutenIntolerant` to `true`. You might find John's phone number and set the corresponding session attribute.
            fulfillment-code-hook: |-
                Specifies that Amazon Lex invokes the alias Lambda function when the intent is ready for fulfillment. You can invoke this function to complete the bot's transaction with the user.

                For example, in a pizza ordering bot, the Lambda function can look up the closest pizza restaurant to the customer's location and then place an order on the customer's behalf.

            input-contexts: |-
                A list of contexts that must be active for this intent to be considered by Amazon Lex.

                When an intent has an input context list, Amazon Lex only considers using the intent in an interaction with the user when the specified contexts are included in the active context list for the session. If the contexts are not active, then Amazon Lex will not use the intent.

                A context can be automatically activated using the `outputContexts` property or it can be set at runtime.

                For example, if there are two intents with different input contexts that respond to the same utterances, only the intent with the active context will respond.

                An intent may have up to 5 input contexts. If an intent has multiple input contexts, all of the contexts must be active to consider the intent.
            intent-closing-setting: Sets the response that Amazon Lex sends to the user when the intent is closed.
            intent-confirmation-setting: Provides prompts that Amazon Lex sends to the user to confirm the completion of an intent. If the user answers "no," the settings contain a statement that is sent to the user to end the intent.
            intent-display-name: A display name for the intent. If configured, This name will be shown to users during Intent Disambiguation instead of the intent name. Display names should be user-friendly, descriptive and match the intent's purpose to improve user experience during disambiguation.
            intent-name: The name of the intent. Intent names must be unique in the locale that contains the intent and cannot match the name of any built-in intent.
            kendra-configuration: Configuration information required to use the `AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent` intent to connect to an Amazon Kendra index. The `AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent` intent is called when Amazon Lex can't determine another intent to invoke.
            locale-id: The identifier of the language and locale where this intent is used. All of the bots, slot types, and slots used by the intent must have the same locale. For more information, see [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/how-languages.html).

                You can use an output context to indicate the intents that Amazon Lex should consider for the next turn of the conversation with a customer.

                When you use the `outputContextsList` property, all of the contexts specified in the list are activated when the intent is fulfilled. You can set up to 10 output contexts. You can also set the number of conversation turns that the context should be active, or the length of time that the context should be active.
            parent-intent-signature: A unique identifier for the built-in intent to base this intent on.

In each object, use the `name` field to specify the metric to calculate, the `statistic` field to specify whether to calculate the `Sum`, `Average`, or `Max` number, and the `order` field to specify whether to sort the results in `Ascending` or `Descending` order.

            - Use the `filters` field to filter the results, the `groupBy` field to specify categories by which to group the results, and the `binBy` field to specify time intervals by which to group the results.
            - Use the `maxResults` field to limit the number of results to return in a single response and the `nextToken` field to return the next batch of results if the response does not return the full set of results.
