            Updates the specified [WebACL](). While updating a web ACL, WAF provides continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated with the web ACL.

            This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the web ACL with the ones that you provide to this call.

            To modify a web ACL, do the following:

            1. Retrieve it by calling [GetWebACL]()
            2. Update its settings as needed
            3. Provide the complete web ACL specification to this call

            A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types [Rule](), [RuleGroup](), and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resource types include Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, Amplify application, and Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

            **Temporary inconsistencies during updates**

            When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.

            The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:

            - After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.
            - After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.
            - After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.
            - After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

                When using `UpdateWebACL`, `ApplicationConfig` follows these rules:

                - If you omit `ApplicationConfig` from the request, all existing entries in the web ACL are retained.
                - If you include `ApplicationConfig`, entries must match the existing values exactly. Any attempt to modify existing entries will result in an error.

                You are charged additional fees when your protected resources forward body sizes that are larger than the default. For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/).

            lock-token: A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your `get` and `list` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete`. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException`. If this happens, perform another `get`, and use the new token returned by that operation.
            name: The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL after you create it.
            on-source-d-do-s-protection-config: Specifies the type of DDoS protection to apply to web request data for a web ACL. For most scenarios, it is recommended to use the default protection level, `ACTIVE_UNDER_DDOS`. If a web ACL is associated with multiple Application Load Balancers, the changes you make to DDoS protection in that web ACL will apply to all associated Application Load Balancers.
            rules: The [Rule]() statements used to identify the web requests that you want to manage. Each rule includes one top-level statement that WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how WAF handles them.
            scope: |-
                Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use `CLOUDFRONT`.

                To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

                - CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1`.
                - API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
            token-domains: |-
                Specifies the domains that WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites. When WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the Amazon Web Services resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify a list of token domains, WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, WAF accepts the resource's host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains.

                Example JSON: `"TokenDomains": { "mywebsite.com", "myotherwebsite.com" }`

                Public suffixes aren't allowed. For example, you can't use `gov.au` or `co.uk` as token domains.

            The maximum number of addresses that can be blocked for a single rate-based rule instance is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses exceed the rate limit, those with the highest rates are blocked.

            WAF monitors web requests and manages keys independently for each unique combination of web ACL, optional rule group, and rate-based rule. For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for that web ACL, rule group reference statement, and rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group in a second web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for this second usage completely independent of your first.

            Creates a [RuleGroup]() per the specifications provided.

            A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a [WebACL](). When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements.
        flag:
            capacity: |-
                The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

                When you create your own rule group, you define this, and you cannot change it after creation. When you add or modify the rules in a rule group, WAF enforces this limit. You can check the capacity for a set of rules using [CheckCapacity]().

                WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. For more information, see [WAF web ACL capacity units (WCU)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-waf-capacity-units.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

            Updates the specified [RegexPatternSet]().

            This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the regex pattern set with the ones that you provide to this call.

            To modify a regex pattern set, do the following:

            1. Retrieve it by calling [GetRegexPatternSet]()
            2. Update its settings as needed
            3. Provide the complete regex pattern set specification to this call

            **Temporary inconsistencies during updates**

            When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.

            The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:

            - After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.
            - After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.
            - After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.
            - After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

            WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. For more information, see [WAF web ACL capacity units (WCU)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-waf-capacity-units.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

Customers can retrieve the available versions for a managed rule group by calling [ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions](). You provide a rule group specification for each version. For each managed rule set, you must specify a version that you recommend using.

            To initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version, use [UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate]().

            **Temporary inconsistencies during updates**

            When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.

            The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:

            - After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.
            - After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.
            - After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.
            - After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

                Contains an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses that you want WAF to inspect for in incoming requests. All addresses must be specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for `/0`.

                Example address strings:

                - For requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify `192.0.2.44/32`.

                - For requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128`.

            Updates the specified [RuleGroup]().

            This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the rule group with the ones that you provide to this call.

            To modify a rule group, do the following:

            1. Retrieve it by calling [GetRuleGroup]()
            2. Update its settings as needed
            3. Provide the complete rule group specification to this call

            A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a [WebACL](). When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements.

            **Temporary inconsistencies during updates**

            When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.

            The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:

            - After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.
            - After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.
            - After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.
            - After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

            application-config: Configures the ability for the WAF console to store and retrieve application attributes during the web ACL creation process. Application attributes help WAF give recommendations for protection packs.
            association-config: |-
                Specifies custom configurations for the associations between the web ACL and protected resources.

                Use this to customize the maximum size of the request body that your protected resources forward to WAF for inspection. You can customize this setting for CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, or Verified Access resources. The default setting is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).

                You are charged additional fees when your protected resources forward body sizes that are larger than the default. For more information, see [WAF Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/).

                For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).
            captcha-config: Specifies how WAF should handle `CAPTCHA` evaluations for rules that don't have their own `CaptchaConfig` settings. If you don't specify this, WAF uses its default settings for `CaptchaConfig`.
            challenge-config: Specifies how WAF should handle challenge evaluations for rules that don't have their own `ChallengeConfig` settings. If you don't specify this, WAF uses its default settings for `ChallengeConfig`.
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            custom-response-bodies: |-
                A map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you create a rule with a block action, you can send a custom response to the web request. You define these for the web ACL, and then use them in the rules and default actions that you define in the web ACL.

                For information about customizing web requests and responses, see [Customizing web requests and responses in WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

                For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see [WAF quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *WAF Developer Guide*.
            data-protection-config: |-
                Specifies data protection to apply to the web request data for the web ACL. This is a web ACL level data protection option.

                The data protection that you configure for the web ACL alters the data that's available for any other data collection activity, including your WAF logging destinations, web ACL request sampling, and Amazon Security Lake data collection and management. Your other option for data protection is in the logging configuration, which only affects logging.
            default-action: The action to perform if none of the `Rules` contained in the `WebACL` match.
            description: A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            name: The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL after you create it.
            on-source-d-do-s-protection-config: Specifies the type of DDoS protection to apply to web request data for a web ACL. For most scenarios, it is recommended to use the default protection level, `ACTIVE_UNDER_DDOS`. If a web ACL is associated with multiple Application Load Balancers, the changes you make to DDoS protection in that web ACL will apply to all associated Application Load Balancers.
            rules: The [Rule]() statements used to identify the web requests that you want to manage. Each rule includes one top-level statement that WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how WAF handles them.
            scope: |-
                Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use `CLOUDFRONT`.

                To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

                - CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1`.
                - API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
            tags: An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.
            token-domains: |-
                Specifies the domains that WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites. When WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the Amazon Web Services resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify a list of token domains, WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, WAF accepts the resource's host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains.

                Example JSON: `"TokenDomains": { "mywebsite.com", "myotherwebsite.com" }`

                Public suffixes aren't allowed. For example, you can't use `gov.au` or `co.uk` as token domains.
            visibility-config: Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection.

        This is the latest version of the **WAF** API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.

        If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. WAF Classic support will end on September 30, 2025.

        For information about WAF, including how to migrate your WAF Classic resources to this version, see the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html).

        WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to a protected resource. Protected resource types include Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, Amplify application, and Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.

        This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html).

        You can make calls using the endpoints listed in [WAF endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html).

        - For regional resources, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.
        - For Amazon CloudFront and Amplify, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.

        Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).
