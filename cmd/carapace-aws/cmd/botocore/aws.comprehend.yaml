                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Creates a classification request to analyze a single document in real-time. `ClassifyDocument` supports the following model types:

            - Custom classifier - a custom model that you have created and trained. For input, you can provide plain text, a single-page document (PDF, Word, or image), or Amazon Textract API output. For more information, see [Custom classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-document-classification.html) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*.
            - Prompt safety classifier - Amazon Comprehend provides a pre-trained model for classifying input prompts for generative AI applications. For input, you provide English plain text input. For prompt safety classification, the response includes only the `Classes` field. For more information about prompt safety classifiers, see [Prompt safety classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/trust-safety.html#prompt-classification) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*.

            If the system detects errors while processing a page in the input document, the API response includes an `Errors` field that describes the errors.

            If the system detects a document-level error in your input document, the API returns an `InvalidRequestException` error response. For details about this exception, see [Errors in semi-structured documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/idp-inputs-sync-err.html) in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

                To classify a document using the prompt safety classifier, use the `Text` parameter for input.

                Provide the input document as a sequence of base64-encoded bytes. If your code uses an Amazon Web Services SDK to classify documents, the SDK may encode the document file bytes for you.

                The maximum length of this field depends on the input document type. For details, see [Inputs for real-time custom analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/idp-inputs-sync.html) in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

            If the job state is `IN_PROGRESS` the job is marked for termination and put into the `STOP_REQUESTED` state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the `COMPLETED` state; otherwise the job is stopped and put into the `STOPPED` state.

            If the job is in the `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` state when you call the `StopDominantLanguageDetectionJob` operation, the operation returns a 400 Internal Request Exception.

            When you create the flywheel, Comprehend creates a data lake in your account. The data lake holds the training data and test data for all versions of the model.

            To use a flywheel with an existing trained model, you specify the active model version. Comprehend copies the model's training data and test data into the flywheel's data lake.

            To use the flywheel with a new model, you need to provide a dataset for training data (and optional test data) when you create the flywheel.

            For more information about flywheels, see [Flywheel overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/flywheels-about.html) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*.

            Detects named entities in input text when you use the pre-trained model. Detects custom entities if you have a custom entity recognition model.

            When detecting named entities using the pre-trained model, use plain text as the input. For more information about named entities, see [Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-entities.html) in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

            When you use a custom entity recognition model, you can input plain text or you can upload a single-page input document (text, PDF, Word, or image).

            If the system detects errors while processing a page in the input document, the API response includes an entry in `Errors` for each error.

            If the system detects a document-level error in your input document, the API returns an `InvalidRequestException` error response. For details about this exception, see [Errors in semi-structured documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/idp-inputs-sync-err.html) in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

                Use the `Bytes` parameter to input a text, PDF, Word or image file. Using a plain-text file in the `Bytes` parameter is equivelent to using the `Text` parameter (the `Entities` field in the response is identical).

                You can also use the `Bytes` parameter to input an Amazon Textract `DetectDocumentText` or `AnalyzeDocument` output file.

                Provide the input document as a sequence of base64-encoded bytes. If your code uses an Amazon Web Services SDK to detect entities, the SDK may encode the document file bytes for you.

                The maximum length of this field depends on the input document type. For details, see [Inputs for real-time custom analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/idp-inputs-sync.html) in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return in each page. The default is 100.
            next-token: Identifies the next page of results to return.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            input-data-config: Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.
            language-code: The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be in the same language.
            mode: Indicates the mode in which the classifier will be trained. The classifier can be trained in multi-class (single-label) mode or multi-label mode. Multi-class mode identifies a single class label for each document and multi-label mode identifies one or more class labels for each document. Multiple labels for an individual document are separated by a delimiter. The default delimiter between labels is a pipe (|).
            model-kms-key-id: |-
                ID for the KMS key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt trained custom models. The ModelKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

                - KMS Key ID: `"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
                - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: `"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
            model-policy: |-
                The resource-based policy to attach to your custom document classifier model. You can use this policy to allow another Amazon Web Services account to import your custom model.

                Provide your policy as a JSON body that you enter as a UTF-8 encoded string without line breaks. To provide valid JSON, enclose the attribute names and values in double quotes. If the JSON body is also enclosed in double quotes, then you must escape the double quotes that are inside the policy:

                `"{\"attribute\": \"value\", \"attribute\": [\"value\"]}"`

                To avoid escaping quotes, you can use single quotes to enclose the policy and double quotes to enclose the JSON names and values:

                `'{"attribute": "value", "attribute": ["value"]}'`
            output-data-config: Specifies the location for the output files from a custom classifier job. This parameter is required for a request that creates a native document model.
            tags: Tags to associate with the document classifier. A tag is a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.
            version-name: The version name given to the newly created classifier. Version names can have a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-) and underscores (\_) are allowed. The version name must be unique among all models with the same classifier name in the Amazon Web Services account/Amazon Web Services Region.
            volume-kms-key-id: |-
                ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that process the analysis job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

                - KMS Key ID: `"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
                - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: `"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
            vpc-config: Configuration parameters for an optional private Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) containing the resources you are using for your custom classifier. For more information, see [Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).
