            Registers an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an extension makes it available for use in CloudFormation templates in your Amazon Web Services account, and includes:

            - Validating the extension schema.
            - Determining which handlers, if any, have been specified for the extension.
            - Making the extension available for use in your account.

            For more information about how to develop extensions and ready them for registration, see [Creating resource types using the CloudFormation CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html) in the *CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide*.

            You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per Region. Use [DeregisterType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterType.html) to deregister specific extension versions if necessary.

            Once you have initiated a registration request using [RegisterType](), you can use [DescribeTypeRegistration]() to monitor the progress of the registration request.

            Once you have registered a private extension in your account and Region, use [SetTypeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_SetTypeConfiguration.html) to specify configuration properties for the extension. For more information, see [Edit configuration data for extensions in your account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-set-configuration.html) in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to assume when invoking the extension.

                For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role must contain a trust relationship with the CloudFormation service principal (`resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com`). For more information about adding trust relationships, see [Modifying a role trust policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-managingrole-editing-console.html#roles-managingrole_edit-trust-policy) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

                If your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an [*IAM execution role*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that includes the necessary permissions to call those Amazon Web Services APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your resource type with the appropriate credentials.

                The user registering the extension must be able to access the package in the S3 bucket. That's, the user needs to have [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html) permissions for the schema handler package. For more information, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html) in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

            max-results: If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a `NextToken` value that you can use for the `NextToken` parameter to get the next set of results. By default the `ListGeneratedTemplates` API action will return at most 50 results in each response. The maximum value is 100.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

                - `NON_PROVISIONABLE`: The resource type doesn't include create, read, and delete handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.

Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates.

If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html) and [AWS::Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.\n  \n  If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.\n  \n  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.\n  \n  Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates.

You might retry `UpdateStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

                All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

                In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

            Detect drift on a StackSet. When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a StackSet, it performs drift detection on the stack associated with each stack instance in the StackSet. For more information, see [Performing drift detection on CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html).

            `DetectStackSetDrift` returns the `OperationId` of the StackSet drift detection operation. Use this operation id with [DescribeStackSetOperation]() to monitor the progress of the drift detection operation. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the number of stack instances included in the StackSet, in addition to the number of resources included in each stack.

            Once the operation has completed, use the following actions to return drift information:

            - Use [DescribeStackSet]() to return detailed information about the stack set, including detailed information about the last *completed* drift operation performed on the StackSet. (Information about drift operations that are in progress isn't included.)
            - Use [ListStackInstances]() to return a list of stack instances belonging to the StackSet, including the drift status and last drift time checked of each instance.
            - Use [DescribeStackInstance]() to return detailed information about a specific stack instance, including its drift status and last drift time checked.

            You can only run a single drift detection operation on a given StackSet at one time.

            To stop a drift detection StackSet operation, use [StopStackSetOperation]().

            Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.

            To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the `ChangeSetType` parameter, specify `CREATE`. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify `UPDATE` for the `ChangeSetType` parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify `IMPORT` for the `ChangeSetType` parameter. After the `CreateChangeSet` call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the [DescribeChangeSet]() action.

            When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the [ExecuteChangeSet]() action. CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set.

If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability.

This must be one of these values:

                - `DELETE` - Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails. This is only valid when the `ChangeSetType` parameter is set to `CREATE`. If the deletion of the stack fails, the status of the stack is `DELETE_FAILED`.
                - `DO_NOTHING` - if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is equivalent to specifying `true` for the `DisableRollback` parameter to the [ExecuteChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html) API operation.
                - `ROLLBACK` - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This is equivalent to specifying `false` for the `DisableRollback` parameter to the [ExecuteChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html) API operation.

                For nested stacks, when the `OnStackFailure` parameter is set to `DELETE` for the change set for the parent stack, any failure in a child stack will cause the parent stack creation to fail and all stacks to be deleted.

CloudFormation uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission.

                If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

                A unique identifier for this `DeleteStack` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry `DeleteStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

                All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

                In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

            Updates the parameter values for stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Amazon Web Services Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region.

            You can only update stack instances in Amazon Web Services Regions and accounts where they already exist; to create additional stack instances, use [CreateStackInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStackInstances.html).

            During StackSet updates, any parameters overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.

            You can only update the parameter *values* that are specified in the StackSet. To add or delete a parameter itself, use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update the StackSet template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the StackSet you must first use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the StackSet. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using `UpdateStackInstances`.

            The maximum number of organizational unit (OUs) supported by a `UpdateStackInstances` operation is 50.

            If you need more than 50, consider the following options:

            - *Batch processing:* If you don't want to expose your OU hierarchy, split up the operations into multiple calls with less than 50 OUs each.
            - *Parent OU strategy:* If you don't mind exposing the OU hierarchy, target a parent OU that contains all desired child OUs.

                Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update operations:

                - To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.
                - To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`. (You can't specify both a value and set `UsePreviousValue` to `true`.)
                - To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the StackSet, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter in the list.
                - To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this property at all.

                During StackSet updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.

                The key-value pairs to associate with this StackSet and the stacks created from it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

                If you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are currently associated with this StackSet. This means:

                - If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags.
                - If you specify *any* tags using this parameter, you must specify *all* the tags that you want associated with this StackSet, even tags you've specified before (for example, when creating the StackSet or during a previous update of the StackSet.). Any tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the StackSet, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.
                - If you specify an empty value, CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags.

                If you specify new tags as part of an `UpdateStackSet` action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the StackSet from the list of tags you specify, CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the StackSet, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire `UpdateStackSet` action fails with an `access denied` error, and the StackSet is not updated.
            template-body: |-

            template-url: |-
                The URL of a file that contains the template body. The URL must point to a template (maximum size: 1 MB) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with `https://`. S3 static website URLs are not supported.

            Continues rolling back a stack from `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` to `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state) and then try to update the stack again.

            A stack enters the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state when CloudFormation can't roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, this might occur when a stack attempts to roll back to an old database that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the instance was deleted, it assumes the instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

            For more information, see [Continue rolling back an update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.html) in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

            resources-to-skip: |-
                A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the `UPDATE_FAILED` state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the `UPDATE_FAILED` state for other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the [DescribeStackResources]() action, and view the resource status reason.

                Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you [troubleshoot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed) resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.

                Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.

                To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: `NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID`. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (`Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) in the `ResourcesToSkip` list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, `DELETE_COMPLETE`, or `DELETE_FAILED`.

                Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see [Continue rolling back from failed nested stack updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.html#nested-stacks).

Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission.

You might retry `CreateStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

                All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

                In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

                If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.

                Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance operations:

                - To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.
                - To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`. (You can't specify both a value and set `UsePreviousValue` to `true`.)
                - To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the StackSet, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter in the list.
                - To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this property at all.

                During StackSet updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.

                You can only override the parameter *values* that are specified in the StackSet; to add or delete a parameter itself, use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update the StackSet template.

        command: |-
            Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, CloudFormation compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see [Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).

            Use `DetectStackDrift` to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or [DetectStackResourceDrift]() to detect drift on individual resources.

            For a list of stack resources that currently support drift detection, see [Resource type support for imports and drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html).

            `DetectStackDrift` can take up to several minutes, depending on the number of resources contained within the stack. Use [DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus]() to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use [DescribeStackResourceDrifts]() to return drift information about the stack and its resources.

            When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation doesn't detect drift on any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform `DetectStackDrift` directly on the nested stack itself.

            Returns information about a new or existing template. The `GetTemplateSummary` action is useful for viewing parameter information, such as default parameter values and parameter types, before you create or update a stack or StackSet.

            You can use the `GetTemplateSummary` action when you submit a template, or you can get template information for a StackSet, or a running or deleted stack.

            For deleted stacks, `GetTemplateSummary` returns the template information for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted. If the template doesn't exist, a `ValidationError` is returned.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a `NextToken` value that you can assign to the `NextToken` request parameter to get the next set of results.
            next-token: The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            stack-refactor-id: The ID associated with the stack refactor created from the [CreateStackRefactor]() action.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Marks an extension or extension version as `DEPRECATED` in the CloudFormation registry, removing it from active use. Deprecated extensions or extension versions cannot be used in CloudFormation operations.

            To deregister an entire extension, you must individually deregister all active versions of that extension. If an extension has only a single active version, deregistering that version results in the extension itself being deregistered and marked as deprecated in the registry.

            You can't deregister the default version of an extension if there are other active version of that extension. If you do deregister the default version of an extension, the extension type itself is deregistered as well and marked as deprecated.

            To view the deprecation status of an extension or extension version, use [DescribeType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html).

            Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack drift detection operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted. For more information about stack and resource drift, see [Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).

            Use [DetectStackDrift]() to initiate a stack drift detection operation. `DetectStackDrift` returns a `StackDriftDetectionId` you can use to monitor the progress of the operation using `DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus`. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use [DescribeStackResourceDrifts]() to return drift information about the stack and its resources.

            To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the type was registered. For more information, see [RegisterType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html).

            Once you've initiated testing on an extension using `TestType`, you can pass the returned `TypeVersionArn` into [DescribeType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html) to monitor the current test status and test status description for the extension.

            An extension must have a test status of `PASSED` before it can be published. For more information, see [Publishing extensions to make them available for public use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-publish.html) in the *CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide*.

                cli-input-json: |-
                    Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                    The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                    If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                    It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                    This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                next-token: The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)
                stack-name: If you specified the name of a change set, specify the stack name or ID (ARN) of the change set you want to describe.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
