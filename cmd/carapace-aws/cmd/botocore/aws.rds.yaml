            engine-lifecycle-support: |-
                The life cycle type for this DB instance.

                By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case, creating the DB instance will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.

                This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster.

                You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                Valid Values: `open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`

                Default: `open-source-rds-extended-support`
            engine-version: |-
                The version number of the database engine to use.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The version number of the database engine the DB instance uses is managed by the DB cluster.

                For a list of valid engine versions, use the `DescribeDBEngineVersions` operation.

                The following are the database engines and links to information about the major and minor versions that are available with Amazon RDS. Not every database engine is available for every Amazon Web Services Region.

            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            iops: |-
                The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to initially allocate for the DB instance. For information about valid IOPS values, see [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster.

                Constraints:

                - For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
                - For RDS for SQL Server - Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
            kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB instance.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see `CreateDBCluster`.

                If `StorageEncrypted` is enabled, and you do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                For Amazon RDS Custom, a KMS key is required for DB instances. For most RDS engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling `StorageEncrypted`, the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS Custom doesn't use the default key when this parameter is empty. You must explicitly specify a key.
            license-model: |-
                The license model information for this DB instance.

                License models for RDS for Db2 require additional configuration. The bring your own license (BYOL) model requires a custom parameter group and an Amazon Web Services License Manager self-managed license. The Db2 license through Amazon Web Services Marketplace model requires an Amazon Web Services Marketplace subscription. For more information, see [Amazon RDS for Db2 licensing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                The default for RDS for Db2 is `bring-your-own-license`.

                - RDS for PostgreSQL - `postgresql-license`
            manage-master-user-password: |-
                Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

                For more information, see [Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Constraints:

                - Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if `MasterUserPassword` is specified.
            master-user-authentication-type: |-
                Specifies the authentication type for the master user. With IAM master user authentication, you can configure the master DB user with IAM database authentication when you create a DB instance.

                You can specify one of the following values:

                - `password` - Use standard database authentication with a password.
                - `iam-db-auth` - Use IAM database authentication for the master user.

                This option is only valid for RDS for PostgreSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL engines.
            master-user-password: |-
                The password for the master user.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The password for the master user is managed by the DB cluster.

                Constraints:

                - Can't be specified if `ManageMasterUserPassword` is turned on.
                - Can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@". For RDS for Oracle, can't include the "&amp;" (ampersand) or the "'" (single quotes) character.

                - RDS for PostgreSQL - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.
            master-user-secret-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

                This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                If you don't specify `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId`, then the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

                There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            master-username: |-
                The name for the master user.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The name for the master user is managed by the DB cluster.

                For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see [Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

                - Amazon Aurora (Storage is managed by the DB cluster.)
                - RDS Custom
            monitoring-interval: |-
                The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify `0`.

                If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, then you must set `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than `0`.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values: `0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60`

                Default: `0`
            monitoring-role-arn: |-
                The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`. For information on creating a monitoring role, see [Setting Up and Enabling Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than `0`, then you must supply a `MonitoringRoleArn` value.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            multi-az: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. You can't set the `AvailabilityZone` parameter if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora because the DB instance Availability Zones (AZs) are managed by the DB cluster.
            multi-tenant: |-
                Specifies whether to use the multi-tenant configuration or the single-tenant configuration (default). This parameter only applies to RDS for Oracle container database (CDB) engines.

                Note the following restrictions:

                - The DB engine that you specify in the request must support the multi-tenant configuration. If you attempt to enable the multi-tenant configuration on a DB engine that doesn't support it, the request fails.
                - If you specify the multi-tenant configuration when you create your DB instance, you can't later modify this DB instance to use the single-tenant configuration.
            nchar-character-set-name: |-
                The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.

            option-group-name: |-
                The option group to associate the DB instance with.

                Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group. Also, that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.
            performance-insights-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you don't specify a value for `PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            performance-insights-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

            preferred-backup-window: |-
                The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the `BackupRetentionPeriod` parameter. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see [Backup window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster.

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the format `hh24:mi-hh24:mi`.
                - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
                - Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
                - Must be at least 30 minutes.
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                The time range each week during which system maintenance can occur. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#Concepts.DBMaintenance) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of the week.

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the format `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`.
                - The day values must be `mon | tue | wed | thu | fri | sat | sun`.
                - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
                - Must not conflict with the preferred backup window.
                - Must be at least 30 minutes.
            processor-features: |-
                The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.
            promotion-tier: |-
                The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see [Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.AuroraHighAvailability.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Default: `1`

                Valid Values: `0 - 15`
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its domain name system (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is controlled by its security group settings.

                When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                The default behavior when `PubliclyAccessible` is not specified depends on whether a `DBSubnetGroup` is specified.

                If `DBSubnetGroup` isn't specified, `PubliclyAccessible` defaults to `false` for Aurora instances and `true` for non-Aurora instances.

            Switches over the specified secondary DB cluster to be the new primary DB cluster in the global database cluster. Switchover operations were previously called "managed planned failovers."

            Aurora promotes the specified secondary cluster to assume full read/write capabilities and demotes the current primary cluster to a secondary (read-only) cluster, maintaining the orginal replication topology. All secondary clusters are synchronized with the primary at the beginning of the process so the new primary continues operations for the Aurora global database without losing any data. Your database is unavailable for a short time while the primary and selected secondary clusters are assuming their new roles. For more information about switching over an Aurora global database, see [Performing switchovers for Amazon Aurora global databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

            This operation is intended for controlled environments, for operations such as "regional rotation" or to fall back to the original primary after a global database failover.

            Creates a blue/green deployment.

            A blue/green deployment creates a staging environment that copies the production environment. In a blue/green deployment, the blue environment is the current production environment. The green environment is the staging environment, and it stays in sync with the current production environment.

            You can make changes to the databases in the green environment without affecting production workloads. For example, you can upgrade the major or minor DB engine version, change database parameters, or make schema changes in the staging environment. You can thoroughly test changes in the green environment. When ready, you can switch over the environments to promote the green environment to be the new production environment. The switchover typically takes under a minute.

            After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless v1 can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down.

For more information about scaling points, see [Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

            This operation only applies to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters.
        flag:
            capacity: |-
                The DB cluster capacity.

                When you change the capacity of a paused Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster, it automatically resumes.

                Constraints:

                - For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, and `256`.
                - For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `192`, and `384`.

            Enables ingress to a DBSecurityGroup using one of two forms of authorization. First, EC2 or VPC security groups can be added to the DBSecurityGroup if the application using the database is running on EC2 or VPC instances. Second, IP ranges are available if the application accessing your database is running on the internet. Required parameters for this API are one of CIDR range, EC2SecurityGroupId for VPC, or (EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId and either EC2SecurityGroupName or EC2SecurityGroupId for non-VPC).

            You can't authorize ingress from an EC2 security group in one Amazon Web Services Region to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another. You can't authorize ingress from a VPC security group in one VPC to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another.

It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.\n\nYou must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\nThe presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:\n\n- `DestinationRegion` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted DB snapshot is copied to. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the `CopyDBSnapshot` operation is called that contains this presigned URL.\n  \n  For example, if you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the `CopyDBSnapshot` operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the `CopyDBSnapshot` operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the `DestinationRegion` in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.\n- `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the `CopyDBSnapshot` operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.\n- `SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB snapshot identifier for the encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier` looks like the following example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20161115`.\n\nTo learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).\n\nIf you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region."

                If you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.

                If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Region than the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot ARN. You can also specify an ARN of a snapshot that is in a different account and a different Amazon Web Services Region. For example, you might specify `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805`.

            Creates an RDS event notification subscription. This operation requires a topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by either the RDS console, the SNS console, or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console.

            You can specify the type of source (`SourceType`) that you want to be notified of and provide a list of RDS sources (`SourceIds`) that triggers the events. You can also provide a list of event categories (`EventCategories`) for events that you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify `SourceType` = `db-instance`, `SourceIds` = `mydbinstance1`, `mydbinstance2` and `EventCategories` = `Availability`, `Backup`.

            If you specify both the `SourceType` and `SourceIds`, such as `SourceType` = `db-instance` and `SourceIds` = `myDBInstance1`, you are notified of all the `db-instance` events for the specified source. If you specify a `SourceType` but do not specify `SourceIds`, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your RDS sources. If you don't specify either the SourceType or the `SourceIds`, you are notified of events generated from all RDS sources belonging to your customer account.

            Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

            To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

            You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` operation is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the following values:

            - `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.
            - `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.
            - `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the same value as the `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` in the presigned URL.

            To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.

                If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services account, you can specify a value for `KmsKeyId` to encrypt the copy with a new KMS key. If you don't specify a value for `KmsKeyId`, then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.

                If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for `KmsKeyId`.

                To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services Region, you must set `KmsKeyId` to the Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

                If you copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, an error is returned.
            pre-signed-url: |-
                When you are copying a DB cluster snapshot from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API operation in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB cluster snapshot to copy. Use the `PreSignedUrl` parameter when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

                This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.

                The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

                - `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
                - `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.
                - `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` looks like the following example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`.

                To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

                If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

            Deletes a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. However, manual DB snapshots of the DB instance aren't deleted.

            If you request a final DB snapshot, the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is `deleting` until the DB snapshot is created. This operation can't be canceled or reverted after it begins. To monitor the status of this operation, use `DescribeDBInstance`.

            When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of `failed`, `incompatible-restore`, or `incompatible-network`, you can only delete it when you skip creation of the final snapshot with the `SkipFinalSnapshot` parameter.

            If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:

            - The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
            - The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.

            To delete a DB instance in this case, first use the `PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster` operation to promote the DB cluster so that it's no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, use the `DeleteDBInstance` operation to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.

            For RDS Custom DB instances, deleting the DB instance permanently deletes the EC2 instance and the associated EBS volumes. Make sure that you don't terminate or delete these resources before you delete the DB instance. Otherwise, deleting the DB instance and creation of the final snapshot might fail.

                If you don't enable this parameter, you must specify the `FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier` parameter.

                When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of `failed`, `incompatible-restore`, or `incompatible-network`, RDS can delete the instance only if you enable this parameter.

                If you delete a read replica or an RDS Custom instance, you must enable this setting.

To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using `ModifyDBParameterGroup`. Once you've created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance using `ModifyDBInstance`.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            db-proxy-name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
            debug-logging: Specifies whether the proxy logs detailed connection and query information. When you enable `DebugLogging`, the proxy captures connection details and connection pool behavior from your queries. Debug logging increases CloudWatch costs and can impact proxy performance. Enable this option only when you need to troubleshoot connection or performance issues.
            default-auth-scheme: The default authentication scheme that the proxy uses for client connections to the proxy and connections from the proxy to the underlying database. Valid values are `NONE` and `IAM_AUTH`. When set to `IAM_AUTH`, the proxy uses end-to-end IAM authentication to connect to the database. If you don't specify `DefaultAuthScheme` or specify this parameter as `NONE`, you must specify the `Auth` option.
            endpoint-network-type: |-
                The network type of the DB proxy endpoint. The network type determines the IP version that the proxy endpoint supports.

                Valid values:

                - `IPV4` - The proxy endpoint supports IPv4 only.
                - `IPV6` - The proxy endpoint supports IPv6 only.
                - `DUAL` - The proxy endpoint supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

                Default: `IPV4`

                Constraints:

                - If you specify `IPV6` or `DUAL`, the VPC and all subnets must have an IPv6 CIDR block.
                - If you specify `IPV6` or `DUAL`, the VPC tenancy cannot be `dedicated`.
            engine-family: The kinds of databases that the proxy can connect to. This value determines which database network protocol the proxy recognizes when it interprets network traffic to and from the database. For Aurora MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and RDS for MySQL databases, specify `MYSQL`. For Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS for PostgreSQL databases, specify `POSTGRESQL`. For RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, specify `SQLSERVER`.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            idle-client-timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.
            require-tls: Specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy.
            role-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.
            tags: An optional set of key-value pairs to associate arbitrary data of your choosing with the proxy.
            target-connection-network-type: |-
                The network type that the proxy uses to connect to the target database. The network type determines the IP version that the proxy uses for connections to the database.

                Valid values:

                - `IPV4` - The proxy connects to the database using IPv4 only.
                - `IPV6` - The proxy connects to the database using IPv6 only.

                Default: `IPV4`

                Constraints:

                - If you specify `IPV6`, the database must support dual-stack mode. RDS doesn't support IPv6-only databases.
                - All targets registered with the proxy must be compatible with the specified network type.
            vpc-security-group-ids: One or more VPC security group IDs to associate with the new proxy.

                Specifies whether to enable this DB cluster to forward write operations to the primary cluster of a global cluster (Aurora global database). By default, write operations are not allowed on Aurora DB clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global database.

                You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that are members of an Aurora global database. With this parameter enabled, a secondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster, and the resulting changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is used immediately if the primary is demoted by a global cluster API operation, but it does nothing until then.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
            enable-http-endpoint: |-
                Specifies whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint isn't enabled.

                When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service API (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS console with the RDS query editor.

                For more information, see [Using RDS Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

                This parameter applies only to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters. To enable or disable the HTTP endpoint for an Aurora Serverless v2 or provisioned DB cluster, use the `EnableHttpEndpoint` and `DisableHttpEndpoint` operations.

                If the DB cluster doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this case, you can't specify `MasterUserPassword`.

                If the DB cluster already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify `MasterUserPassword`. In this case, RDS deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by `MasterUserPassword`.

                The life cycle type for this DB cluster.

                By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB cluster to a higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of standard support date.

                You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version.

If you set this value to `false` or don't specify it, RDS creates a DB cluster snapshot before it deletes the DB cluster. By default, this parameter is disabled, so RDS creates a final DB cluster snapshot.

To switch over a global database cluster, we recommend that you use the [SwitchoverGlobalCluster]() operation instead.\n\nHow you use this operation depends on whether you are failing over or switching over your global database cluster:\n\n- Failing over - Specify the `AllowDataLoss` parameter and don't specify the `Switchover` parameter.\n- Switching over - Specify the `Switchover` parameter or omit it, but don't specify the `AllowDataLoss` parameter.\n\n**About failing over and switching over**\n\nWhile failing over and switching over a global database cluster both change the primary DB cluster, you use these operations for different reasons:\n\n- *Failing over* - Use this operation to respond to an unplanned event, such as a Regional disaster in the primary Region. Failing over can result in a loss of write transaction data that wasn't replicated to the chosen secondary before the failover event occurred. However, the recovery process that promotes a DB instance on the chosen seconday DB cluster to be the primary writer DB instance guarantees that the data is in a transactionally consistent state.\n  \n  For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see [Performing managed failovers for Aurora global databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-failover.managed-unplanned) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.\n- *Switching over* - Use this operation on a healthy global database cluster for planned events, such as Regional rotation or to fail back to the original primary DB cluster after a failover operation. With this operation, there is no data loss.\n  \n  For more information about switching over an Amazon Aurora global database, see [Performing switchovers for Aurora global databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*."

            You might need to reboot your DB cluster, usually for maintenance reasons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you change the DB cluster parameter group associated with the DB cluster, reboot the DB cluster for the changes to take effect.

            Rebooting a DB cluster restarts the database engine service. Rebooting a DB cluster results in a momentary outage, during which the DB cluster status is set to rebooting.

            Use this operation only for a non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB cluster.

            engine-lifecycle-support: |-
                The life cycle type for this DB instance.

                By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB instance to a higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of standard support date.

                You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster.

                This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                If you don't specify `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId`, then the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

                There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            max-allocated-storage: |-
                The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance.

            network-type: |-
                The network type of the DB instance.

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the DB instance. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Valid Values:

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

                When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                For more information, see [CreateDBInstance]().
            restore-time: |-
                The date and time to restore from.

            Forces a failover for a DB cluster.

            For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster writer).

            For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, after RDS terminates the primary DB instance, the internal monitoring system detects that the primary DB instance is unhealthy and promotes a readable standby (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster writer). Failover times are typically less than 35 seconds.

            An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if one exists, when the primary DB instance fails. A Multi-AZ DB cluster automatically fails over to a readable standby DB instance when the primary DB instance fails.

            To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.

            For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see [What is Amazon Aurora?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

        command: |-
            Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.

            If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` operation. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the `DBInstanceIdentifier` in the call to the `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` operation. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot.

            If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the `DBSnapshotIdentifier` must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

            To restore from a DB snapshot with an unsupported engine version, you must first upgrade the engine version of the snapshot. For more information about upgrading a RDS for MySQL DB snapshot engine version, see [Upgrading a MySQL DB snapshot engine version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/mysql-upgrade-snapshot.html). For more information about upgrading a RDS for PostgreSQL DB snapshot engine version, [Upgrading a PostgreSQL DB snapshot engine version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBSnapshot.PostgreSQL.html).

            This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use `RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot`.
        flag:
            allocated-storage: |-
                The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially for the DB instance. Follow the allocation rules specified in CreateDBInstance.

                This setting isn't valid for RDS for SQL Server.

                Be sure to allocate enough storage for your new DB instance so that the restore operation can succeed. You can also allocate additional storage for future growth.
            auto-minor-version-upgrade: |-
                Specifies whether to automatically apply minor version upgrades to the DB instance during the maintenance window.

                The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

                Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

                Constraint: You can't specify the `AvailabilityZone` parameter if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

                Example: `us-east-1a`
            backup-target: |-
                Specifies where automated backups and manual snapshots are stored for the restored DB instance.

                Possible values are `local` (Dedicated Local Zone), `outposts` (Amazon Web Services Outposts), and `region` (Amazon Web Services Region). The default is `region`.

                For more information, see [Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
            ca-certificate-identifier: |-

            copy-tags-to-snapshot: |-
                Specifies whether to copy all tags from the restored DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance.

                In most cases, tags aren't copied by default. However, when you restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you specify new tags. If yes, the new tags are added to the restored DB instance. If there are no new tags, RDS looks for the tags from the source DB instance for the DB snapshot, and then adds those tags to the restored DB instance.

                For more information, see [Copying tags to DB instance snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.CopyTags) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            engine: |-
                The database engine to use for the new instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

                Default: The same as source

                Constraint: Must be compatible with the engine of the source. For example, you can restore a MariaDB 10.1 DB instance from a MySQL 5.6 snapshot.

                Valid Values:

                - `db2-ae`
                - `db2-se`

                - `sqlserver-web`
            engine-lifecycle-support: |-
                The life cycle type for this DB instance.

                By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB instance to a higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of standard support date.

                You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster.

                Default: `open-source-rds-extended-support`
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            iops: |-
                Specifies the amount of provisioned IOPS for the DB instance, expressed in I/O operations per second. If this parameter isn't specified, the IOPS value is taken from the backup. If this parameter is set to 0, the new instance is converted to a non-PIOPS instance. The conversion takes additional time, though your DB instance is available for connections before the conversion starts.

                The provisioned IOPS value must follow the requirements for your database engine. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Constraints: Must be an integer greater than 1000.
            license-model: |-
                License model information for the restored DB instance.

                License models for RDS for Db2 require additional configuration. The bring your own license (BYOL) model requires a custom parameter group and an Amazon Web Services License Manager self-managed license. The Db2 license through Amazon Web Services Marketplace model requires an Amazon Web Services Marketplace subscription. For more information, see [Amazon RDS for Db2 licensing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values:

                - RDS for Db2 - `bring-your-own-license | marketplace-license`
                - RDS for MariaDB - `general-public-license`
                - RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - `license-included`
                - RDS for MySQL - `general-public-license`
                - RDS for Oracle - `bring-your-own-license | license-included`
                - RDS for PostgreSQL - `postgresql-license`

                Default: Same as the source.
            manage-master-user-password: |-
                Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the restored DB instance.

            master-user-secret-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

                This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                If you don't specify `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId`, then the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

                There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            multi-az: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

                Valid Values:

                - `IPV4`
                - `DUAL`

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the DB instance. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
            option-group-name: |-
                The name of the option group to be used for the restored DB instance.

                Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            port: |-
                The port number on which the database accepts connections.

                Default: The same port as the original DB instance

                Constraints: Value must be `1150-65535`
            processor-features: |-
                The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

                When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                For more information, see [CreateDBInstance]().
            storage-throughput: |-
                Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.
            storage-type: |-
                Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.

                Valid Values: `gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`

                If you specify `io1`, `io2`, or `gp3`, you must also include a value for the `Iops` parameter.

                Default: `io1` if the `Iops` parameter is specified, otherwise `gp3`
            tags: ""
            tde-credential-arn: |-
                The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            tde-credential-password: |-
                The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            use-default-processor-features: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
            vpc-security-group-ids: |-
                A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB instance.

                Specifies whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon Web Services account. By default, the public snapshots are not included.

                You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public by using the [ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute]() API action.
            include-shared: |-
                Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services account has been given permission to copy or restore. By default, these snapshots are not included.

                You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a manual DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by the `ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` API action.
            marker: An optional pagination token provided by a previous `DescribeDBClusterSnapshots` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by `MaxRecords`.

                Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            snapshot-type: |-
                The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

                - `manual` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon Web Services account.
                - `shared` - Return all manual DB cluster snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.
                - `public` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked as public.

                If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared DB cluster snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared` parameter. You can include public DB cluster snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.

                The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `public`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

            The target DB cluster is created from the source snapshot with a default configuration. If you don't specify a security group, the new DB cluster is associated with the default security group.

            This operation only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the `CreateDBInstance` operation to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in `DBClusterIdentifier`. You can create DB instances only after the `RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot` operation has completed and the DB cluster is available.

                For information about valid IOPS values, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                Constraints: Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                When you don't specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

                - If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.
                - If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` isn't encrypted, then the restored DB cluster isn't encrypted.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            monitoring-interval: |-
                The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB cluster. To turn off collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify `0`.

                If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, also set `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than `0`.

                Valid Values: `0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60`

                Default: `0`
            monitoring-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An example is `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`.

                If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than `0`, supply a `MonitoringRoleArn` value.
            network-type: |-
                The network type of the DB cluster.

                Valid Values:

                - `IPV4`
                - `DUAL`

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the DB cluster. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.*

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
            option-group-name: |-
                The name of the option group to use for the restored DB cluster.

                DB clusters are associated with a default option group that can't be modified.
            performance-insights-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you don't specify a value for `PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            performance-insights-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

                Valid Values:

                - `7`
                - *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: `93` (3 months * 31), `341` (11 months * 31), `589` (19 months * 31)
                - `731`

                Default: `7` days

                If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as `94`, Amazon RDS issues an error.
            port: |-
                The port number on which the new DB cluster accepts connections.

                Constraints: This value must be `1150-65535`

                Default: The same port as the original DB cluster.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

                When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

                When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified.

                If `DBSubnetGroupName` isn't specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:

                - If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
                - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

                If `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:

                - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
                - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            rds-custom-cluster-configuration: Reserved for future use.
            scaling-configuration: |-
                For DB clusters in `serverless` DB engine mode, the scaling properties of the DB cluster.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
            serverless-v2-scaling-configuration: ""
            snapshot-identifier: |-
                The identifier for the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from.

                You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB snapshot.

                Constraints:

                - Must match the identifier of an existing Snapshot.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            storage-type: |-
                Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB cluster.

                When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the `Iops` parameter is required.

                Valid Values: `aurora`, `aurora-iopt1` (Aurora DB clusters); `io1` (Multi-AZ DB clusters)

                Default: `aurora` (Aurora DB clusters); `io1` (Multi-AZ DB clusters)

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            tags: |-

            Creates a new Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

            If you create an Aurora DB cluster, the request creates an empty cluster. You must explicitly create the writer instance for your DB cluster using the [CreateDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html) operation. If you create a Multi-AZ DB cluster, the request creates a writer and two reader DB instances for you, each in a different Availability Zone.

            You can use the `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` parameter to create an Amazon Aurora DB cluster as a read replica of another DB cluster or Amazon RDS for MySQL or PostgreSQL DB instance. For more information about Amazon Aurora, see [What is Amazon Aurora?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

            You can also use the `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` parameter to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster read replica with an RDS for MySQL or PostgreSQL DB instance as the source. For more information about Multi-AZ DB clusters, see [Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                The life cycle type for this DB cluster.

                By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case, creating the DB cluster will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.

                You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                When a KMS key isn't specified in `KmsKeyId`:

                - If `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon RDS uses the KMS key used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.
                - If the `StorageEncrypted` parameter is enabled and `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` isn't specified, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.

                There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                If you create a read replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another Amazon Web Services Region, make sure to set `KmsKeyId` to a KMS key identifier that is valid in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This KMS key is used to encrypt the read replica in that Amazon Web Services Region.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

                This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB cluster.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                If you don't specify `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId`, then the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

                There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you don't specify a value for `PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            performance-insights-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                Valid Values:

                - `7`
                - *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: `93` (3 months * 31), `341` (11 months * 31), `589` (19 months * 31)
                - `731`

                Default: `7` days

                If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as `94`, Amazon RDS issues an error.
            port: |-
                The port number on which the instances in the DB cluster accept connections.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                Valid Values: `1150-65535`

                Default:

                - RDS for MySQL and Aurora MySQL - `3306`
                - RDS for PostgreSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL - `5432`
            pre-signed-url: |-
                When you are replicating a DB cluster from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, an URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBCluster` operation to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. Specify `PreSignedUrl` only when you are performing cross-Region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.

                The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBCluster` API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to copy.

                The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

                - `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the `CreateDBCluster` operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
                - `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that Aurora read replica will be created in.
                - `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` would look like Example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1`.

                To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

                If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
            preferred-backup-window: |-
                The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled using the `BackupRetentionPeriod` parameter.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region.

            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of the week. To see the time blocks available, see [Adjusting the Preferred DB Cluster Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.Aurora) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the format `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`.

            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

                When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC), its domain name system (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB cluster, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is controlled by its security group settings.

                When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                The default behavior when `PubliclyAccessible` is not specified depends on whether a `DBSubnetGroup` is specified.

                If `DBSubnetGroup` isn't specified, `PubliclyAccessible` defaults to `true`.

                If `DBSubnetGroup` is specified, `PubliclyAccessible` defaults to `false` unless the value of `DBSubnetGroup` is `default`, in which case `PubliclyAccessible` defaults to `true`.

                If `PubliclyAccessible` is true and the VPC that the `DBSubnetGroup` is in doesn't have an internet gateway attached to it, Amazon RDS returns an error.

                This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

                When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the `Iops` parameter is required.

                Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                Valid Values:

                - Aurora DB clusters - `aurora | aurora-iopt1`
                - Multi-AZ DB clusters - `io1 | io2 | gp3`

                Default:

                - Aurora DB clusters - `aurora`
                - Multi-AZ DB clusters - `io1`

                When you create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set to `aurora-iopt1`, the storage type is returned in the response. The storage type isn't returned when you set it to `aurora`.

                inactive

                You can change any status to any status. A typical reason to change status is to prevent the accidental use of a CEV, or to make a deprecated CEV eligible for use again. For example, you might change the status of your CEV from `available` to `inactive`, and from `inactive` back to `available`. To change the availability status of the CEV, it must not currently be in use by an RDS Custom instance, snapshot, or automated backup.

            There are two types of parameters - dynamic parameters and static parameters. Changes to dynamic parameters are applied to the DB cluster immediately without a reboot. Changes to static parameters are applied only after the DB cluster is rebooted, which can be done using `RebootDBCluster` operation. You can use the *Parameter Groups* option of the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) or the `DescribeDBClusterParameters` operation to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.

            Creates a new DB cluster parameter group.

            Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a DB cluster.

            A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using `ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup`. Once you've created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using `ModifyDBCluster`.

            When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Aurora DB cluster, reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.

            When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Multi-AZ DB cluster, reboot the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.

            After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the `character_set_database` parameter. You can use the *Parameter Groups* option of the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) or the `DescribeDBClusterParameters` operation to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.

                Specifies whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible.

                When the DB shard group is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB shard group's VPC. Access to the DB shard group is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB shard group doesn't permit it.

                When the DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB shard group with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified.

                If `DBSubnetGroupName` isn't specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:

                - If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB shard group is private.
                - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB shard group is public.

                If `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:

                - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB shard group is private.
                - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB shard group is public.

            Creates a new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. You can create a read replica for a DB instance running Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. You can create a read replica for a Multi-AZ DB cluster running MySQL or PostgreSQL. For more information, see [Working with read replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) and [Migrating from a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a DB instance using a read replica](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html#multi-az-db-clusters-migrating-to-instance-with-read-replica) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

            Amazon Aurora doesn't support this operation. To create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster, use the `CreateDBInstance` operation.

            RDS creates read replicas with backups disabled. All other attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance or cluster, except as specified.

            Your source DB instance or cluster must have backup retention enabled.
        flag:

                - The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix `AWSRDSCustom`.

                For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see [Configure IAM and your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting is required for RDS Custom DB instances.
            database-insights-mode: |-
                The mode of Database Insights to enable for the read replica.

                This setting isn't supported.
            db-instance-class: |-
                The compute and memory capacity of the read replica, for example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see [DB Instance Class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

            db-parameter-group-name: |-
                The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this read replica DB instance.

                For the Db2 DB engine, if your source DB instance uses the bring your own license (BYOL) model, then a custom parameter group must be associated with the replica. For a same Amazon Web Services Region replica, if you don't specify a custom parameter group, Amazon RDS associates the custom parameter group associated with the source DB instance. For a cross-Region replica, you must specify a custom parameter group. This custom parameter group must include your IBM Site ID and IBM Customer ID. For more information, see [IBM IDs for bring your own license (BYOL) for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html#db2-prereqs-ibm-info).

                For Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB instance read replica instances, if you don't specify a value for `DBParameterGroupName`, then Amazon RDS uses the `DBParameterGroup` of the source DB instance for a same Region read replica, or the default `DBParameterGroup` for the specified DB engine for a cross-Region read replica.

                For Multi-AZ DB cluster same Region read replica instances, if you don't specify a value for `DBParameterGroupName`, then Amazon RDS uses the default `DBParameterGroup`.

                Specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported for MySQL DB instances for cross-Region read replicas, for Multi-AZ DB cluster read replica instances, for Db2 DB instances, and for Oracle DB instances. It isn't supported for MySQL DB instances for same Region read replicas or for RDS Custom.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance or cluster.

                If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

                You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key as the primary replica.
            max-allocated-storage: |-
                The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance.

            monitoring-interval: |-
                The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify `0`. The default is `0`.

                If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, then you must set `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than `0`.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values: `0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60`

                Default: `0`
            monitoring-role-arn: |-
                The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`. For information on creating a monitoring role, go to [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a `MonitoringRoleArn` value.

            multi-az: |-
                Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment.

                You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source is a Multi-AZ DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            network-type: |-
                The network type of the DB instance.

                Valid Values:

                - `IPV4`
                - `DUAL`

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for read replica. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                The option group to associate the DB instance with. If not specified, RDS uses the option group associated with the source DB instance or cluster.

                For SQL Server, you must use the option group associated with the source.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            performance-insights-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you do not specify a value for `PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            performance-insights-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

                - `731`

                Default: `7` days

                If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as `94`, Amazon RDS returns an error.
            port: |-
                The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

                Valid Values: `1150-65535`

                Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.
            pre-signed-url: "When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance.\n\nThis setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.\n\nThis setting applies only when replicating from a source DB *instance*. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions.\n\nYou must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\nThe presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:\n\n- `DestinationRegion` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation is called that contains this presigned URL.\n  \n  For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the `DestinationRegion` in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.\n- `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.\n- `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` looks like the following example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115`.\n\nTo learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).\n\nIf you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.\n\nThis setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances."
            processor-features: |-
                The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

                When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                For more information, see [CreateDBInstance]().
            replica-mode: |-
                The open mode of the replica database.

                This parameter is only supported for Db2 DB instances and Oracle DB instances.

                Db2

                Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload.

                You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working with replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-replication.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to `mounted`.

                Oracle

                Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.

                You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to `mounted`. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually.
            source-db-cluster-identifier: |-
                The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas.

                - The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.
                - The source DB cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported.
            source-db-instance-identifier: |-
                The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas, except for the following engines:

                - Db2 - Can have up to three replicas.
                - Oracle - Can have up to five read replicas.
                - SQL Server - Can have up to five read replicas.

                Constraints:

                - Must be the identifier of an existing Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.
                - Can't be specified if the `SourceDBClusterIdentifier` parameter is also specified.
                - For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see [Version and licensing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.limitations.html#oracle-read-replicas.limitations.versions-and-licenses) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                - The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.
                - If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.
                - If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, see [Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*. This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.
            storage-throughput: |-

                The storage type to associate with the read replica.

                If you specify `io1`, `io2`, or `gp3`, you must also include a value for the `Iops` parameter.

                Valid Values: `gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`

                Default: `io1` if the `Iops` parameter is specified. Otherwise, `gp3`.

        command: Modifies settings for a DB instance. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance, call `DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications` before you call `ModifyDBInstance`.
        flag:
            allocated-storage: |-
                The new amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate for the DB instance.

                For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for PostgreSQL, the value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.

                For the valid values for allocated storage for each engine, see `CreateDBInstance`.

                Constraints:

                - When you increase the allocated storage for a DB instance that uses Provisioned IOPS (`gp3`, `io1`, or `io2` storage type), you must also specify the `Iops` parameter. You can use the current value for `Iops`.
            allow-major-version-upgrade: |-
                Specifies whether major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Constraints:

                - Major version upgrades must be allowed when specifying a value for the `EngineVersion` parameter that's a different major version than the DB instance's current version.
            apply-immediately: |-
                Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` setting for the DB instance. By default, this parameter is disabled.

                If this parameter is disabled, changes to the DB instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to [RebootDBInstance](), or the next failure reboot. Review the table of parameters in [Modifying a DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* to see the impact of enabling or disabling `ApplyImmediately` for each modified parameter and to determine when the changes are applied.
            auto-minor-version-upgrade: |-
                Specifies whether minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. An outage occurs when all the following conditions are met:

                - The automatic upgrade is enabled for the maintenance window.
                - A newer minor version is available.
                - RDS has enabled automatic patching for the engine version.

                If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, Amazon RDS applies the change as soon as possible and doesn't cause an outage.

                For an RDS Custom DB instance, don't enable this setting. Otherwise, the operation returns an error.

                For more information about automatic minor version upgrades, see [Automatically upgrading the minor engine version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.AutoMinorVersionUpgrades).
            automation-mode: The automation mode of the RDS Custom DB instance. If `full`, the DB instance automates monitoring and instance recovery. If `all paused`, the instance pauses automation for the duration set by `ResumeFullAutomationModeMinutes`.
            aws-backup-recovery-point-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in Amazon Web Services Backup.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            backup-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

                Enabling and disabling backups can result in a brief I/O suspension that lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size and class of your DB instance.

                These changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request. If you change the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see `ModifyDBCluster`.

                Default: Uses existing setting

                Constraints:

                - Must be a value from 0 to 35.
                - Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas.
                - Can't be set to 0 for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.
            ca-certificate-identifier: |-
                The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                For more information, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* and [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.
            certificate-rotation-restart: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate.

                By default, the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate. The certificate is not updated until the DB instance is restarted.

                Set this parameter only if you are *not* using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance.

                If you are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate your SSL/TLS certificate:

                - For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
                - For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration: |-
                The log types to be enabled for export to CloudWatch Logs for a specific DB instance.

                A change to the `CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration` parameter is always applied to the DB instance immediately. Therefore, the `ApplyImmediately` parameter has no effect.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                The following values are valid for each DB engine:

                - Aurora MySQL - `audit | error | general | slowquery | iam-db-auth-error`
                - Aurora PostgreSQL - `postgresql | iam-db-auth-error`
                - RDS for MySQL - `error | general | slowquery | iam-db-auth-error`
                - RDS for PostgreSQL - `postgresql | upgrade | iam-db-auth-error`

                For more information about exporting CloudWatch Logs for Amazon RDS, see [Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                For more information about exporting CloudWatch Logs for Amazon Aurora, see [Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.
            copy-tags-to-snapshot: |-
                Specifies whether to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags aren't copied.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB cluster. Setting this value for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on the DB cluster setting. For more information, see `ModifyDBCluster`.
            database-insights-mode: |-
                Specifies the mode of Database Insights to enable for the DB instance.

                Aurora DB instances inherit this value from the DB cluster, so you can't change this value.
            db-instance-class: |-
                The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example `db.m4.large`. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see [DB Instance Class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* or [Aurora DB instance classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*. For RDS Custom, see [DB instance class support for RDS Custom for Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-reqs-limits.html#custom-reqs-limits.instances) and [DB instance class support for RDS Custom for SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-reqs-limits-MS.html#custom-reqs-limits.instancesMS).

                If you modify the DB instance class, an outage occurs during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you specify `ApplyImmediately` in your request.

                Default: Uses existing setting

                Constraints:

                - If you are modifying the DB instance class and upgrading the engine version at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB instance class.
            db-instance-identifier: |-
                The identifier of DB instance to modify. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

                Constraints:

                - Must match the identifier of an existing DB instance.
            db-parameter-group-name: |-
                The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance.

                Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage. The parameter group name itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter changes are not applied until you reboot the instance without failover. In this case, the DB instance isn't rebooted automatically, and the parameter changes aren't applied during the next maintenance window. However, if you modify dynamic parameters in the newly associated DB parameter group, these changes are applied immediately without a reboot.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Default: Uses existing setting

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the same DB parameter group family as the DB instance.
            db-port-number: |-
                The port number on which the database accepts connections.

                The value of the `DBPortNumber` parameter must not match any of the port values specified for options in the option group for the DB instance.

                If you change the `DBPortNumber` value, your database restarts regardless of the value of the `ApplyImmediately` parameter.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values: `1150-65535`

                Default:

                - Amazon Aurora - `3306`
                - RDS for Db2 - `50000`
                - RDS for MariaDB - `3306`
                - RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - `1433`
                - RDS for MySQL - `3306`
                - RDS for Oracle - `1521`
                - RDS for PostgreSQL - `5432`

                Constraints:

                - For RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, the value can't be `1234`, `1434`, `3260`, `3343`, `3389`, `47001`, or `49152-49156`.
            db-security-groups: |-
                A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Constraints:

                - If supplied, must match existing DB security groups.
            db-subnet-group-name: |-
                The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter to move your DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB instance isn't in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move your DB instance into a VPC. For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Non-VPC2VPC) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you enable `ApplyImmediately`.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Constraints:

                - If supplied, must match existing DB subnet group.

                Example: `mydbsubnetgroup`
            dedicated-log-volume: Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV) enabled.
            deletion-protection: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see [Deleting a DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html).

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. You can enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information, see `ModifyDBCluster`. DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster.
            disable-domain: Specifies whether to remove the DB instance from the Active Directory domain.
            domain: |-
                The Active Directory directory ID to move the DB instance to. Specify `none` to remove the instance from its current domain. You must create the domain before this operation. Currently, you can create only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances in an Active Directory Domain.

                For more information, see [Kerberos Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/kerberos-authentication.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            domain-auth-secret-arn: |-
                The ARN for the Secrets Manager secret with the credentials for the user joining the domain.

                Example: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456`
            domain-dns-ips: |-
                The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory domain controllers.

                Constraints:

                - Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for both entries in the list.

                Example: `123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237`
            domain-fqdn: |-
                The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory domain.

                Constraints:

                - Can't be longer than 64 characters.

                Example: `mymanagedADtest.mymanagedAD.mydomain`
            domain-iam-role-name: |-
                The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory Service.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            domain-ou: |-
                The Active Directory organizational unit for your DB instance to join.

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the distinguished name format.

                Example: `OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain`
            enable-customer-owned-ip: |-
                Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

                A *CoIP* provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

                For more information about RDS on Outposts, see [Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                For more information about CoIPs, see [Customer-owned IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing) in the *Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide*.
            enable-iam-database-authentication: |-
                Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora. Mapping Amazon Web Services IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the DB cluster.

                For more information about IAM database authentication, see [IAM Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            enable-performance-insights: |-
                Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the DB instance.

                For more information, see [Using Amazon Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            engine: |-
                The target Oracle DB engine when you convert a non-CDB to a CDB. This intermediate step is necessary to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c non-CDB to an Oracle Database 21c CDB.

                Note the following requirements:

                - Make sure that you specify `oracle-ee-cdb` or `oracle-se2-cdb`.
                - Make sure that your DB engine runs Oracle Database 19c with an April 2021 or later RU.

                Note the following limitations:

                - You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB.
                - You can't convert a replica database.
                - You can't convert a non-CDB to a CDB and upgrade the engine version in the same command.
                - You can't convert the existing custom parameter or option group when it has options or parameters that are permanent or persistent. In this situation, the DB instance reverts to the default option and parameter group. To avoid reverting to the default, specify a new parameter group with `--db-parameter-group-name` and a new option group with `--option-group-name`.
            engine-version: |-
                The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request.

                For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family.

                If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS updates the DB instance to the default minor version if the current minor version is lower. For information about valid engine versions, see `CreateDBInstance`, or call `DescribeDBEngineVersions`.

                If the instance that you're modifying is acting as a read replica, the engine version that you specify must be the same or higher than the version that the source DB instance or cluster is running.

                In RDS Custom for Oracle, this parameter is supported for read replicas only if they are in the `PATCH_DB_FAILURE` lifecycle.

                Constraints:

                - If you are upgrading the engine version and modifying the DB instance class at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB instance class.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            iops: |-
                The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance.

                Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect.

                If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

                Constraints:

                - For RDS for MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for PostgreSQL - The value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.
                - When you increase the Provisioned IOPS, you must also specify the `AllocatedStorage` parameter. You can use the current value for `AllocatedStorage`.

                Default: Uses existing setting
            license-model: |-
                The license model for the DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values:

                - RDS for Db2 - `bring-your-own-license`

            manage-master-user-password: |-
                Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

                If the DB instance doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this case, you can't specify `MasterUserPassword`.

                If the DB instance already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify `MasterUserPassword`. In this case, Amazon RDS deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by `MasterUserPassword`.

                For more information, see [Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Constraints:

                - Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if `MasterUserPassword` is specified.
                - Can't specify for RDS for Oracle CDB instances in the multi-tenant configuration. Use `ModifyTenantDatabase` instead.
                - Can't specify the parameters `ManageMasterUserPassword` and `MultiTenant` in the same operation.
            master-user-authentication-type: |-
                Specifies the authentication type for the master user. With IAM master user authentication, you can change the master DB user to use IAM database authentication.

                You can specify one of the following values:

                - `password` - Use standard database authentication with a password.
                - `iam-db-auth` - Use IAM database authentication for the master user.

                This option is only valid for RDS for PostgreSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL engines.
            master-user-password: "The new password for the master user.\n\nChanging this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the `MasterUserPassword` element exists in the `PendingModifiedValues` element of the operation response.\n\nAmazon RDS API operations never return the password, so this operation provides a way to regain access to a primary instance user if the password is lost.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            monitoring-interval: |-
                The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify `0`.

                If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, set `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than `0`.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values: `0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60`

                Default: `0`
            monitoring-role-arn: |-
                The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`. For information on creating a monitoring role, see [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than `0`, supply a `MonitoringRoleArn` value.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            multi-az: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            multi-tenant: |-
                Specifies whether the to convert your DB instance from the single-tenant conﬁguration to the multi-tenant conﬁguration. This parameter is supported only for RDS for Oracle CDB instances.

                During the conversion, RDS creates an initial tenant database and associates the DB name, master user name, character set, and national character set metadata with this database. The tags associated with the instance also propagate to the initial tenant database. You can add more tenant databases to your DB instance by using the `CreateTenantDatabase` operation.

                The conversion to the multi-tenant configuration is permanent and irreversible, so you can't later convert back to the single-tenant configuration. When you specify this parameter, you must also specify `ApplyImmediately`.
            network-type: |-
                The network type of the DB instance.

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the DB instance. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Valid Values: `IPV4 | DUAL`
            new-db-instance-identifier: |-
                The new identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot occurs immediately if you enable `ApplyImmediately`, or will occur during the next maintenance window if you disable `ApplyImmediately`. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Constraints:

                - Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
                - The first character must be a letter.
                - Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

                Example: `mydbinstance`
            option-group-name: |-
                The option group to associate the DB instance with.

                Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one exception. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, it can cause a brief period, lasting less than a second, during which new connections are rejected but existing connections aren't interrupted.

                The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request.

                Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            performance-insights-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you don't specify a value for `PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            performance-insights-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Valid Values:

                - `7`
                - *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: `93` (3 months * 31), `341` (11 months * 31), `589` (19 months * 31)
                - `731`

                Default: `7` days

                If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as `94`, Amazon RDS returns an error.
            preferred-backup-window: |-
                The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the `BackupRetentionPeriod` parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see [Backup window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see `ModifyDBCluster`.

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the format `hh24:mi-hh24:mi`.
                - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
                - Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
                - Must be at least 30 minutes.
            preferred-maintenance-window: |-
                The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter causes a reboot of the DB instance. If you change this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

                For more information, see [Amazon RDS Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#Concepts.DBMaintenance) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Default: Uses existing setting

                Constraints:

                - Must be in the format `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`.
                - The day values must be `mon | tue | wed | thu | fri | sat | sun`.
                - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
                - Must not conflict with the preferred backup window.

            processor-features: |-
                The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            promotion-tier: |-
                The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see [Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.AuroraHighAvailability.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

                Default: `1`

                Valid Values: `0 - 15`
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

                When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                `PubliclyAccessible` only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a public subnet and `PubliclyAccessible` must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible.

                Changes to the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter are applied immediately regardless of the value of the `ApplyImmediately` parameter.
            replica-mode: |-
                The open mode of a replica database.

                This parameter is only supported for Db2 DB instances and Oracle DB instances.

                Db2

                Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload.

                You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working with replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-replication.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to `mounted`.

                Oracle

                Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.

                You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

                For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to `mounted`. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually.
            resume-full-automation-mode-minutes: |-
                The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time period ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation.

                Default: `60`

                Constraints:

                - Must be at least 60.
                - Must be no more than 1,440.
            rotate-master-user-password: |-
                Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password.

                This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance. The secret value contains the updated password.

                For more information, see [Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

                Constraints:

                - You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user password.
            storage-throughput: |-
                The storage throughput value for the DB instance.

                This setting applies only to the `gp3` storage type.

                This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.
            storage-type: |-
                The storage type to associate with the DB instance.

                If you specify `io1`, `io2`, or `gp3` you must also include a value for the `Iops` parameter.

                If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to gp2 (General Purpose SSD), gp3, or Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from these storage types to standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

                Valid Values: `gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`

                Default: `io1`, if the `Iops` parameter is specified. Otherwise, `gp2`.
            tde-credential-arn: |-
                The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            tde-credential-password: |-
                The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            use-default-processor-features: |-
                Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features.

                This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
            vpc-security-group-ids: |-
                A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

                This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

                - Amazon Aurora (The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see `ModifyDBCluster`.)
                - RDS Custom

                Constraints:

                - If supplied, must match existing VPC security group IDs.

        command: |-
            Modifies the parameters of a DB parameter group. To modify more than one parameter, submit a list of the following: `ParameterName`, `ParameterValue`, and `ApplyMethod`. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request.

            After you modify a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the modify operation before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the `character_set_database` parameter. You can use the *Parameter Groups* option of the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) or the *DescribeDBParameters* command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.

                An array of parameter names, values, and the application methods for the parameter update. At least one parameter name, value, and application method must be supplied; later arguments are optional. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request.

                Valid Values (for the application method): `immediate | pending-reboot`

                You can use the `immediate` value with dynamic parameters only. You can use the `pending-reboot` value for both dynamic and static parameters.

                When the application method is `immediate`, changes to dynamic parameters are applied immediately to the DB instances associated with the parameter group.

                When the application method is `pending-reboot`, changes to dynamic and static parameters are applied after a reboot without failover to the DB instances associated with the parameter group.

                You can't use `pending-reboot` with dynamic parameters on RDS for SQL Server DB instances. Use `immediate`.

            To share a manual DB snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify `restore` as the `AttributeName` and use the `ValuesToAdd` parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB snapshot. Uses the value `all` to make the manual DB snapshot public, which means it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.

            Don't add the `all` value for any manual DB snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.

            If the manual DB snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the `ValuesToAdd` parameter. You can't use `all` as a value for that parameter in this case.

            To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB snapshot, or whether a manual DB snapshot public or private, use the [DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes]() API operation. The accounts are returned as values for the `restore` attribute.

                Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

                When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

                When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                For more information, see [CreateDBInstance]().

            - The CEV must not be the default for RDS Custom. If it is, change the default before running this command.
            - The CEV must not be associated with an RDS Custom DB instance, RDS Custom instance snapshot, or automated backup of your RDS Custom instance.

            Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances, or remove the override.

            By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided by RDS.

            You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:

            - You already migrated your applications to support the latest certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region.
            - RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process of supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need additional time to finish your application changes.

        command: |-
            Restores a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to any point in time before `LatestRestorableTime` for up to `BackupRetentionPeriod` days. The target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group. Unless the `RestoreType` is set to `copy-on-write`, the restore may occur in a different Availability Zone (AZ) from the original DB cluster. The AZ where RDS restores the DB cluster depends on the AZs in the specified subnet group.

            For Aurora, this operation only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the `CreateDBInstance` operation to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in `DBClusterIdentifier`. You can create DB instances only after the `RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime` operation has completed and the DB cluster is available.

                The life cycle type for this DB cluster.

                By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB cluster to a higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of standard support date.

                You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version.

            engine-mode: |-
                The engine mode of the new cluster. Specify `provisioned` or `serverless`, depending on the type of the cluster you are creating. You can create an Aurora Serverless v1 clone from a provisioned cluster, or a provisioned clone from an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster. To create a clone that is an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster, the original cluster must be an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster or an encrypted provisioned cluster. To create a full copy that is an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster, specify the engine mode `serverless`.

            kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted DB cluster from an encrypted DB cluster.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

                You can restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster with a KMS key that is different from the KMS key used to encrypt the source DB cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS key identified by the `KmsKeyId` parameter.

                If you don't specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

                - If the DB cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source DB cluster.
                - If the DB cluster isn't encrypted, then the restored DB cluster isn't encrypted.

                If `DBClusterIdentifier` refers to a DB cluster that isn't encrypted, then the restore request is rejected.

                Valid Values: `0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60`

                Default: `0`
            monitoring-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An example is `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`.

                If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than `0`, supply a `MonitoringRoleArn` value.
            network-type: |-
                The network type of the DB cluster.

                Valid Values:

                - `IPV4`
                - `DUAL`

                The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for the DB cluster. A `DBSubnetGroup` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (`DUAL`).

                For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.*

                The name of the option group for the new DB cluster.

                DB clusters are associated with a default option group that can't be modified.
            performance-insights-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

                The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                If you don't specify a value for `PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
            performance-insights-retention-period: |-
                The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

                Valid Values:

                - `7`
                - *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: `93` (3 months * 31), `341` (11 months * 31), `589` (19 months * 31)
                - `731`

                Default: `7` days

                If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as `94`, Amazon RDS issues an error.
            port: |-
                The port number on which the new DB cluster accepts connections.

                Constraints: A value from `1150-65535`.

                Default: The default port for the engine.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
            publicly-accessible: |-
                Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

                When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

                When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

                Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified.

                If `DBSubnetGroupName` isn't specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:

                - If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
                - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

                If `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't specified, the following applies:

                - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
                - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

                Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

            restore-type: |-
                The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:

                - `full-copy` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.
                - `copy-on-write` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster.

                If you don't specify a `RestoreType` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.

                Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

                    - `db-cluster-id` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
                    - `db-cluster-snapshot-id` - Accepts DB cluster snapshot identifiers.
                    - `snapshot-type` - Accepts types of DB cluster snapshots.
                    - `engine` - Accepts names of database engines.
                generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                    If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                    This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
                include-public: |-
                    Specifies whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon Web Services account. By default, the public snapshots are not included.

                    You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public by using the [ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute]() API action.
                include-shared: |-
                    Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services account has been given permission to copy or restore. By default, these snapshots are not included.

                    You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a manual DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by the `ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` API action.
                marker: An optional pagination token provided by a previous `DescribeDBClusterSnapshots` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by `MaxRecords`.
                max-items: |-
                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-records: |-
                    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so you can retrieve the remaining results.

                    Default: 100

                    Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                snapshot-type: |-
                    The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

                    - `automated` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.
                    - `manual` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon Web Services account.
                    - `shared` - Return all manual DB cluster snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.
                    - `public` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked as public.

                    If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared DB cluster snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared` parameter. You can include public DB cluster snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.

                    The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `public`.
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                    You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using the `ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute` API action.

                    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
                marker: An optional pagination token provided by a previous `DescribeDBSnapshots` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by `MaxRecords`.
                max-items: |-
                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-records: |-
                    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.

                    Default: 100

                    Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                snapshot-type: "The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:\n\n- `automated` - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.\n- `manual` - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon Web Services account.\n- `shared` - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.\n- `public` - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.\n- `awsbackup` - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Services Backup service.\n  \n  For information about Amazon Web Services Backup, see the [*Amazon Web Services Backup Developer Guide.*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html)\n  \n  The `awsbackup` type does not apply to Aurora.\n\nIf you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not included in the returned results by default. You can include shared snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared` parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.\n\nThe `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `public`."
                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-records: The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.

        Amazon Relational Database Service

        Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.

        Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

        This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.
