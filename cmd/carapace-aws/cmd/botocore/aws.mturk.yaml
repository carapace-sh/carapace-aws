            The `CreateAdditionalAssignmentsForHIT` operation increases the maximum number of assignments of an existing HIT.

            To extend the maximum number of assignments, specify the number of additional assignments.

            - HITs created with fewer than 10 assignments cannot be extended to have 10 or more assignments. Attempting to add assignments in a way that brings the total number of assignments for a HIT from fewer than 10 assignments to 10 or more assignments will result in an `AWS.MechanicalTurk.InvalidMaximumAssignmentsIncrease` exception.
            - HITs that were created before July 22, 2015 cannot be extended. Attempting to extend HITs that were created before July 22, 2015 will result in an `AWS.MechanicalTurk.HITTooOldForExtension` exception.

            The `ListAssignmentsForHIT` operation retrieves completed assignments for a HIT. You can use this operation to retrieve the results for a HIT.

            You can get assignments for a HIT at any time, even if the HIT is not yet Reviewable. If a HIT requested multiple assignments, and has received some results but has not yet become Reviewable, you can still retrieve the partial results with this operation.

            Use the AssignmentStatus parameter to control which set of assignments for a HIT are returned. The ListAssignmentsForHIT operation can return submitted assignments awaiting approval, or it can return assignments that have already been approved or rejected. You can set AssignmentStatus=Approved,Rejected to get assignments that have already been approved and rejected together in one result set.

            Only the Requester who created the HIT can retrieve the assignments for that HIT.

            Results are sorted and divided into numbered pages and the operation returns a single page of results. You can use the parameters of the operation to control sorting and pagination.

            The `UpdateQualificationType` operation modifies the attributes of an existing Qualification type, which is represented by a QualificationType data structure. Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify its attributes.

            Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after the type has been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries.

            You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test, TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not have an answer key.

            If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test.

            If you want to update the test duration or answer key for an existing test without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the original questions, along with the updated values.

            If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted manually.

            You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes of the Qualification type.

            The `CreateHIT` operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT). The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website.

            This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass these values to `CreateHIT`, a new HIT is created for you, with a new `HITTypeID`. The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.

            An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the `CreateHITType` operation and then call the `CreateHITWithHITType` operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.

            CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the `Question` parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a `HitLayoutId` and associated `HitLayoutParameters`.

            If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see [Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing](https://requester.mturk.com/pricing).
