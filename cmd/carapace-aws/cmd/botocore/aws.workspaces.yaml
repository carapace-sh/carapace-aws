                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Terminates the specified WorkSpaces.

            Terminating a WorkSpace is a permanent action and cannot be undone. The user's data is destroyed. If you need to archive any user data, contact Amazon Web ServicesSupport before terminating the WorkSpace.

            You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except `SUSPENDED`.

            This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the `TERMINATED` state is returned only briefly before the WorkSpace directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned. To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the WorkSpace ID by using [DescribeWorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaces.html). If the WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been successfully terminated.

            Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of charge to use with WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for 30 consecutive days, this directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Amazon WorkSpaces, and you will be charged for this directory as per the [Directory Service pricing terms](http://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/pricing/).

            To delete empty directories, see [Delete the Directory for Your WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/delete-workspaces-directory.html). If you delete your Simple AD or AD Connector directory, you can always create a new one when you want to start using WorkSpaces again.

            Creates an IP access control group.

            An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the IP addresses from which users are allowed to access their WorkSpaces. To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control group and then associate the group with your directory. You can add rules when you create the group or at any time using [AuthorizeIpRules]().

            There is a default IP access control group associated with your directory. If you don't associate an IP access control group with your directory, the default group is used. The default group includes a default rule that allows users to access their WorkSpaces from anywhere. You cannot modify the default IP access control group for your directory.

            The migration process recreates the WorkSpace by using a new root volume from the target bundle image and the user volume from the last available snapshot of the original WorkSpace. During migration, the original `D:\Users\%USERNAME%` user profile folder is renamed to `D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated`. A new `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\` folder is generated by the new OS. Certain files in the old user profile are moved to the new user profile.

            For available migration scenarios, details about what happens during migration, and best practices, see [Migrate a WorkSpace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/migrate-workspaces.html).

If the copy image permission is granted, the image is shared with that account. If the copy image permission is revoked, the image is unshared with the account.

            After an image has been shared, the recipient account can copy the image to other Regions as needed.

            In the China (Ningxia) Region, you can copy images only within the same Region.

            In Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US), to copy images to and from other Regions, contact Amazon Web ServicesSupport.

            For more information about sharing images, see [Share or Unshare a Custom WorkSpaces Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/share-custom-image.html).

            - To delete an image that has been shared, you must unshare the image before you delete it.
            - Sharing Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images across Amazon Web Services accounts isn't supported at this time in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US). To share BYOL images across accounts in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US), contact Amazon Web ServicesSupport.

        Amazon WorkSpaces Service

        Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as *WorkSpaces*. WorkSpaces eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex software. You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access their virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.

        This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Amazon WorkSpaces service, see [WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

        You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces console, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more information about administering WorkSpaces, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/). For more information about using the Amazon WorkSpaces client application or web browser to access provisioned WorkSpaces, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/). For more information about using the CLI to manage your WorkSpaces resources, see the [WorkSpaces section of the CLI Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces/index.html).
