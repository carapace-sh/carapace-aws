            Retrieve Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources over a time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and dimensions, and provide filtering criteria for each group. You must specify an aggregate function for each metric.

            Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are returned.

                The date and time specifying the end of the requested time series query range. The value specified is *exclusive*. Thus, the command returns data points less than (but not equal to) `EndTime`.

                The value for `EndTime` must be later than the value for `StartTime`.

            identifier: |-
                An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Amazon Web Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source. In the console, the identifier is shown as *ResourceID*. When you call `DescribeDBInstances`, the identifier is returned as `DbiResourceId`.

                To use a DB instance as a data source, specify its `DbiResourceId` value. For example, specify `db-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X`.
            max-results: The maximum number of items to return in the response.
            metric-queries: An array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify a Performance Insights metric and specify an aggregate function, and you can provide filtering criteria. You must append the aggregate function to the metric. For example, to find the average for the metric `db.load` you must use `db.load.avg`. Valid values for aggregate functions include `.avg`, `.min`, `.max`, and `.sum`.
            next-token: An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the token, up to the value specified by `MaxRecords`.
            period-alignment: The returned timestamp which is the start or end time of the time periods. The default value is `END_TIME`.
            period-in-seconds: |-
                The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

                - `1` (one second)
                - `60` (one minute)
                - `300` (five minutes)
                - `3600` (one hour)
                - `86400` (twenty-four hours)

                If you don't specify `PeriodInSeconds`, then Performance Insights will choose a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data points in the response.
            service-type: |-
                The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights returns metrics. Valid values are as follows:

                - `RDS`
                - `DOCDB`
            start-time: |-
                The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series query range. You can't specify a `StartTime` that is earlier than 7 days ago. By default, Performance Insights has 7 days of retention, but you can extend this range up to 2 years. The value specified is *inclusive*. Thus, the command returns data points equal to or greater than `StartTime`.

                The value for `StartTime` must be earlier than the value for `EndTime`.

                An immutable, Amazon Web Services Region-unique identifier for a data source. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source.

                To use an Amazon RDS instance as a data source, you specify its `DbiResourceId` value. For example, specify `db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A`.

                - `db.sampledload.avg` - The raw number of active sessions for the database engine.

                If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, `db.load.avg` and `db.sampledload.avg` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with `db.load.avg` showing the scaled values, `db.sampledload.avg` showing the raw values, and `db.sampledload.avg` less than `db.load.avg`. For most use cases, you can query `db.load.avg` only.

            period-in-seconds: |-
                The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

                - `1` (one second)
                - `60` (one minute)
                - `300` (five minutes)

                If you don't specify `PeriodInSeconds`, then Performance Insights chooses a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data points in the response.
            service-type: |-
                The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights will return metrics. Valid values are as follows:

                - `RDS`
                - `DOCDB`
            start-time: |-
                The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series data. You must specify a `StartTime` within the past 7 days. The value specified is *inclusive*, which means that data points equal to or greater than `StartTime` are returned.

                The value for `StartTime` must be earlier than the value for `EndTime`.

        Amazon RDS Performance Insights

        Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.

        When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load.

        DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.
