            Creates a link between a source account and a sink that you have created in a monitoring account. After the link is created, data is sent from the source account to the monitoring account. When you create a link, you can optionally specify filters that specify which metric namespaces and which log groups are shared from the source account to the monitoring account.

            Before you create a link, you must create a sink in the monitoring account and create a sink policy in that account. The sink policy must permit the source account to link to it. You can grant permission to source accounts by granting permission to an entire organization or to individual accounts.

            For more information, see [CreateSink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSink.html) and [PutSinkPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutSinkPolicy.html).

            Each monitoring account can be linked to as many as 100,000 source accounts.

            Each source account can be linked to as many as five monitoring accounts.

                You can use a custom label or use the following variables:

                - `$AccountName` is the name of the account
                - `$AccountEmail` is the globally unique email address of the account
                - `$AccountEmailNoDomain` is the email address of the account without the domain name

                In the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-East) and Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) Regions, the only supported option is to use custom labels, and the `$AccountName`, `$AccountEmail`, and `$AccountEmailNoDomain` variables all resolve as *account-id* instead of the specified variable.

            Use this to create a *sink* in the current account, so that it can be used as a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account observability. A sink is a resource that represents an attachment point in a monitoring account. Source accounts can link to the sink to send observability data.

            After you create a sink, you must create a sink policy that allows source accounts to attach to it. For more information, see [PutSinkPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutSinkPolicy.html).

            Each account can contain one sink per Region. If you delete a sink, you can then create a new one in that Region.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the `TagResource` action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

            Unlike tagging permissions in other Amazon Web Services services, to tag or untag links and sinks you must have the `oam:ResourceTag` permission. The `iam:ResourceTag` permission does not allow you to tag and untag links and sinks.

                The ARN of the resource that you're adding tags to.

                The ARN format of a link is `arn:aws:oam:Region:account-id:link/link-id`

        Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using *CloudWatch cross-account observability*. With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, traces, Application Signals services and service level objectives (SLOs), Application Insights applications, and internet monitors in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.

        Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as *monitoring accounts* and link them with multiple *source accounts*. A monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in X-Ray, Application Signals services and service level objectives (SLOs), applications in Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights, and internet monitors in CloudWatch Internet Monitor.

        When you set up a link, you can choose to share the metrics from all namespaces with the monitoring account, or filter to a subset of namespaces. And for CloudWatch Logs, you can choose to share all log groups with the monitoring account, or filter to a subset of log groups.
