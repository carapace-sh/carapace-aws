                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of channels that you want MediaTailor to return in response to the current request. If there are more than `MaxResults` channels, use the value of `NextToken` in the response to get the next page of results.

                The default value is 100. MediaTailor uses DynamoDB-based pagination, which means that a response might contain fewer than `MaxResults` items, including 0 items, even when more results are available. To retrieve all results, you must continue making requests using the `NextToken` value from each response until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value.
            next-token: |-
                Pagination token returned by the list request when results exceed the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the next page of results.

                For the first `ListChannels` request, omit this value. For subsequent requests, get the value of `NextToken` from the previous response and specify that value for `NextToken` in the request. Continue making requests until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value, which indicates that all results have been retrieved.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of playback configurations that you want MediaTailor to return in response to the current request. If there are more than `MaxResults` playback configurations, use the value of `NextToken` in the response to get the next page of results.

                The default value is 100. MediaTailor uses DynamoDB-based pagination, which means that a response might contain fewer than `MaxResults` items, including 0 items, even when more results are available. To retrieve all results, you must continue making requests using the `NextToken` value from each response until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value.
            next-token: |-
                Pagination token returned by the list request when results exceed the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the next page of results.

                For the first `ListPlaybackConfigurations` request, omit this value. For subsequent requests, get the value of `NextToken` from the previous response and specify that value for `NextToken` in the request. Continue making requests until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value, which indicates that all results have been retrieved.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.

                To use vended logs, you must configure the delivery destination in Amazon CloudWatch, as described in [Enable logging from AWS services, Logging that requires additional permissions \[V2\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html#AWS-vended-logs-permissions-V2).

            percent-enabled: |-
                The percentage of session logs that MediaTailor sends to your CloudWatch Logs account. For example, if your playback configuration has 1000 sessions and percentEnabled is set to `60`, MediaTailor sends logs for 600 of the sessions to CloudWatch Logs. MediaTailor decides at random which of the playback configuration sessions to send logs for. If you want to view logs for a specific session, you can use the [debug log mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/debug-log-mode.html).

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of alerts that you want MediaTailor to return in response to the current request. If there are more than `MaxResults` alerts, use the value of `NextToken` in the response to get the next page of results.

                The default value is 100. MediaTailor uses DynamoDB-based pagination, which means that a response might contain fewer than `MaxResults` items, including 0 items, even when more results are available. To retrieve all results, you must continue making requests using the `NextToken` value from each response until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value.
            next-token: |-
                Pagination token returned by the list request when results exceed the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the next page of results.

                For the first `ListAlerts` request, omit this value. For subsequent requests, get the value of `NextToken` from the previous response and specify that value for `NextToken` in the request. Continue making requests until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value, which indicates that all results have been retrieved.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                The maximum number of live sources that you want MediaTailor to return in response to the current request. If there are more than `MaxResults` live sources, use the value of `NextToken` in the response to get the next page of results.

                The default value is 100. MediaTailor uses DynamoDB-based pagination, which means that a response might contain fewer than `MaxResults` items, including 0 items, even when more results are available. To retrieve all results, you must continue making requests using the `NextToken` value from each response until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value.
            next-token: |-
                Pagination token returned by the list request when results exceed the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the next page of results.

                For the first `ListLiveSources` request, omit this value. For subsequent requests, get the value of `NextToken` from the previous response and specify that value for `NextToken` in the request. Continue making requests until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value, which indicates that all results have been retrieved.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of prefetch schedules that you want MediaTailor to return in response to the current request. If there are more than `MaxResults` prefetch schedules, use the value of `NextToken` in the response to get the next page of results.

                The default value is 100. MediaTailor uses DynamoDB-based pagination, which means that a response might contain fewer than `MaxResults` items, including 0 items, even when more results are available. To retrieve all results, you must continue making requests using the `NextToken` value from each response until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value.
            next-token: |-
                Pagination token returned by the list request when results exceed the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the next page of results.

                For the first `ListPrefetchSchedules` request, omit this value. For subsequent requests, get the value of `NextToken` from the previous response and specify that value for `NextToken` in the request. Continue making requests until the response no longer includes a `NextToken` value, which indicates that all results have been retrieved.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            playback-configuration-name: Retrieves the prefetch schedule(s) for a specific playback configuration.
            schedule-type: The type of prefetch schedules that you want to list. `SINGLE` indicates that you want to list the configured single prefetch schedules. `RECURRING` indicates that you want to list the configured recurring prefetch schedules. `ALL` indicates that you want to list all configured prefetch schedules.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
