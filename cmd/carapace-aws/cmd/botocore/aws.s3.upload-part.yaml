description: Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
flags:
    --body=: Object data.
    --bucket=!: The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
    --checksum-algorithm=: Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK.
    --checksum-cr-c32-c=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-cr-c32=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-cr-c64-nvme=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-sh-a1=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --checksum-sh-a256=: This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided
    --content-length=: Size of the body in bytes.
    --content-m-d5=: The Base64 encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data.
    --expected-bucket-owner=: The account ID of the expected bucket owner.
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request
    --key=!: Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.
    --part-number=!: Part number of part being uploaded.
    --request-payer=: ""
    --sse-customer-algorithm=: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
    --sse-customer-key-m-d5=: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    --sse-customer-key=: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
    --upload-id=!: Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being uploaded.
