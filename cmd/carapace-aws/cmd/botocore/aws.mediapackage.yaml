                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.
