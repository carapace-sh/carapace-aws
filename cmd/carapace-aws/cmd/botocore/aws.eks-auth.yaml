            The Amazon EKS Auth API and the `AssumeRoleForPodIdentity` action are only used by the EKS Pod Identity Agent.

            We recommend that applications use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to connect to Amazon Web Services services; if credentials from an EKS Pod Identity association are available in the pod, the latest versions of the SDKs use them automatically.
