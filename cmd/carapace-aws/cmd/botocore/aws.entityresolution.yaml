        command: Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified Entity Resolution resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. In Entity Resolution, `SchemaMapping` and `MatchingWorkflow` can be tagged. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the `TagResource` action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
