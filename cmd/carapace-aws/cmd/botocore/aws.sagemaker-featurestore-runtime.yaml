      documentation:
        command: |-
            Deletes a `Record` from a `FeatureGroup` in the `OnlineStore`. Feature Store supports both `SoftDelete` and `HardDelete`. For `SoftDelete` (default), feature columns are set to `null` and the record is no longer retrievable by `GetRecord` or `BatchGetRecord`. For `HardDelete`, the complete `Record` is removed from the `OnlineStore`. In both cases, Feature Store appends the deleted record marker to the `OfflineStore`. The deleted record marker is a record with the same `RecordIdentifer` as the original, but with `is_deleted` value set to `True`, `EventTime` set to the delete input `EventTime`, and other feature values set to `null`.

            Note that the `EventTime` specified in `DeleteRecord` should be set later than the `EventTime` of the existing record in the `OnlineStore` for that `RecordIdentifer`. If it is not, the deletion does not occur:

            - For `SoftDelete`, the existing (not deleted) record remains in the `OnlineStore`, though the delete record marker is still written to the `OfflineStore`.
            - `HardDelete` returns `EventTime`: `400 ValidationException` to indicate that the delete operation failed. No delete record marker is written to the `OfflineStore`.

            When a record is deleted from the `OnlineStore`, the deleted record marker is appended to the `OfflineStore`. If you have the Iceberg table format enabled for your `OfflineStore`, you can remove all history of a record from the `OfflineStore` using Amazon Athena or Apache Spark. For information on how to hard delete a record from the `OfflineStore` with the Iceberg table format enabled, see [Delete records from the offline store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store-delete-records-offline-store.html#feature-store-delete-records-offline-store).

            The `PutRecord` API is used to ingest a list of `Records` into your feature group.

            If a new record’s `EventTime` is greater, the new record is written to both the `OnlineStore` and `OfflineStore`. Otherwise, the record is a historic record and it is written only to the `OfflineStore`.

            You can specify the ingestion to be applied to the `OnlineStore`, `OfflineStore`, or both by using the `TargetStores` request parameter.

            You can set the ingested record to expire at a given time to live (TTL) duration after the record’s event time, `ExpiresAt` = `EventTime` + `TtlDuration`, by specifying the `TtlDuration` parameter. A record level `TtlDuration` is set when specifying the `TtlDuration` parameter using the `PutRecord` API call. If the input `TtlDuration` is `null` or unspecified, `TtlDuration` is set to the default feature group level `TtlDuration`. A record level `TtlDuration` supersedes the group level `TtlDuration`.
