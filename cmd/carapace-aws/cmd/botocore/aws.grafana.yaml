            Creates a service account for the workspace. A service account can be used to call Grafana HTTP APIs, and run automated workloads. After creating the service account with the correct `GrafanaRole` for your use case, use `CreateWorkspaceServiceAccountToken` to create a token that can be used to authenticate and authorize Grafana HTTP API calls.

            You can only create service accounts for workspaces that are compatible with Grafana version 9 and above.

            For more information about service accounts, see [Service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/service-accounts.html) in the *Amazon Managed Grafana User Guide*.

The service account acts as a user for the API operations, and defines the permissions that are used by the API.
