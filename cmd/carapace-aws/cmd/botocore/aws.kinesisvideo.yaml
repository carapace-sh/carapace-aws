When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns a new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the `DescribeStream` API.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of edge configurations to return in the response. The default is 5.
            next-token: If you specify this parameter, when the result of a `ListEdgeAgentConfigurations` operation is truncated, the call returns the `NextToken` in the response. To get another batch of edge configurations, provide this token in your next request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Provides an endpoint for the specified signaling channel to send and receive messages. This API uses the `SingleMasterChannelEndpointConfiguration` input parameter, which consists of the `Protocols` and `Role` properties.

            `Protocols` is used to determine the communication mechanism. For example, if you specify `WSS` as the protocol, this API produces a secure websocket endpoint. If you specify `HTTPS` as the protocol, this API generates an HTTPS endpoint. If you specify `WEBRTC` as the protocol, but the signaling channel isn't configured for ingestion, you will receive the error `InvalidArgumentException`.

            `Role` determines the messaging permissions. A `MASTER` role results in this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate with any of the viewers on the channel. A `VIEWER` role results in this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate only with a `MASTER`.

            Creates a new Kinesis video stream.

            When you create a new stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns it a version number. When you change the stream's metadata, Kinesis Video Streams updates the version.

            `CreateStream` is an asynchronous operation.

            For information about how the service works, see [How it Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/how-it-works.html).

            You must have permissions for the `KinesisVideo:CreateStream` action.

            When you invoke this API, the sync status is set to `DELETING`. A deletion process starts, in which active edge jobs are stopped and all media is deleted from the edge device. The time to delete varies, depending on the total amount of stored media. If the deletion process fails, the sync status changes to `DELETE_FAILED`. You will need to re-try the deletion.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            An asynchronous API that updates a stream’s existing edge configuration. The Kinesis Video Stream will sync the stream’s edge configuration with the Edge Agent IoT Greengrass component that runs on an IoT Hub Device, setup at your premise. The time to sync can vary and depends on the connectivity of the Hub Device. The `SyncStatus` will be updated as the edge configuration is acknowledged, and synced with the Edge Agent.

            If this API is invoked for the first time, a new edge configuration will be created for the stream, and the sync status will be set to `SYNCING`. You will have to wait for the sync status to reach a terminal state such as: `IN_SYNC`, or `SYNC_FAILED`, before using this API again. If you invoke this API during the syncing process, a `ResourceInUseException` will be thrown. The connectivity of the stream’s edge configuration and the Edge Agent will be retried for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the status will transition into the `SYNC_FAILED` state.

            To move an edge configuration from one device to another, use [DeleteEdgeConfiguration]() to delete the current edge configuration. You can then invoke StartEdgeConfigurationUpdate with an updated Hub Device ARN.
