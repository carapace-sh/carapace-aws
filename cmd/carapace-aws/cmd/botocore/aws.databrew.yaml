            Deletes one or more versions of a recipe at a time.

            The entire request will be rejected if:

            - The recipe does not exist.
            - There is an invalid version identifier in the list of versions.
            - The version list is empty.
            - The version list size exceeds 50.
            - The version list contains duplicate entries.

            The request will complete successfully, but with partial failures, if:

            - A version does not exist.
            - A version is being used by a job.
            - You specify `LATEST_WORKING`, but it's being used by a project.
            - The version fails to be deleted.

            The `LATEST_WORKING` version will only be deleted if the recipe has no other versions. If you try to delete `LATEST_WORKING` while other versions exist (or if they can't be deleted), then `LATEST_WORKING` will be listed as partial failure in the response.

            cli-input-yaml: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return in this request.
            next-token: The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the next set of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            recipe-version: |-
                Return only those recipes with a version identifier of `LATEST_WORKING` or `LATEST_PUBLISHED`. If `RecipeVersion` is omitted, `ListRecipes` returns all of the `LATEST_PUBLISHED` recipe versions.

                Valid values: `LATEST_WORKING` | `LATEST_PUBLISHED`
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
