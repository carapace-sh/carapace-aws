            Creates a related item (comments, tasks, and contacts) and associates it with a case.

            There's a quota for the number of fields allowed in a Custom type related item. See [Amazon Connect Cases quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#cases-quotas).

            **Use cases**

            Following are examples of related items that you may want to associate with a case:

            - Related contacts, such as calls, chats, emails tasks
            - Comments, for agent notes
            - SLAs, to capture target resolution goals
            - Cases, to capture related Amazon Connect Cases
            - Files, such as policy documentation or customer-provided attachments
            - Custom related items, which provide flexibility for you to define related items that such as bookings, orders, products, notices, and more

            **Important things to know**

            - If you are associating a contact to a case by passing in `Contact` for a `type`, you must have [DescribeContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContact.html) permission on the ARN of the contact that you provide in `content.contact.contactArn`.
            - A Related Item is a resource that is associated with a case. It may or may not have an external identifier linking it to an external resource (for example, a `contactArn`). All Related Items have their own internal identifier, the `relatedItemArn`. Examples of related items include `comments` and `contacts`.
            - If you provide a value for `performedBy.userArn` you must also have [DescribeUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeUser.html) permission on the ARN of the user that you provide.
            - The `type` field is reserved for internal use only.

            Searches for related items across all cases within a domain. This is a global search operation that returns related items from multiple cases, unlike the case-specific [SearchRelatedItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_connect-cases_SearchRelatedItems.html) API.

            **Use cases**

            Following are common uses cases for this API:

            - Find cases with similar issues across the domain. For example, search for all cases containing comments about "product defect" to identify patterns and existing solutions.
            - Locate all cases associated with specific contacts or orders. For example, find all cases linked to a contactArn to understand the complete customer journey.
            - Monitor SLA compliance across cases. For example, search for all cases with "Active" SLA status to prioritize remediation efforts.

            **Important things to know**

            - This API returns case identifiers, not complete case objects. To retrieve full case details, you must make additional calls to the [GetCase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_connect-cases_GetCase.html) API for each returned case ID.
            - This API searches across related items content, not case fields. Use the [SearchCases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_connect-cases_SearchCases.html) API to search within case field values.

            Creates a template in the Cases domain. This template is used to define the case object model (that is, to define what data can be captured on cases) in a Cases domain. A template must have a unique name within a domain, and it must reference existing field IDs and layout IDs. Additionally, multiple fields with same IDs are not allowed within the same Template. A template can be either Active or Inactive, as indicated by its status. Inactive templates cannot be used to create cases.
