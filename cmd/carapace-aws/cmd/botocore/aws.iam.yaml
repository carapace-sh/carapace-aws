            Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM group.

            An IAM group can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the inline policies for a group, use [ListGroupPolicies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroupPolicies.html). For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters. You can use the `PathPrefix` parameter to limit the list of policies to only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies attached to the specified group (or none that match the specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.

                The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the group to list attached policies for.

                This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: \_+=,.@-
            marker: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the `Marker` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
            max-items: |-
                Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            path-prefix: |-
                The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies.

                This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.

            Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user.

            An IAM user can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a user, use [`AttachUserPolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AttachUserPolicy.html) . To create a new managed policy, use [`CreatePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html) . For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a user, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `PutUserPolicy`.

            Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to Inactive, or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable a user's key as part of a key rotation workflow.

            If the `UserName` is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. If a temporary access key is used, then `UserName` is required. If a long-term key is assigned to the user, then `UserName` is not required. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.

                The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range (`\u00FF`). You can also include the tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Amazon Web Services Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

            If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated IAM users.

            max-items: |-
                Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            path-prefix: |-
                The path prefix for filtering the results. For example: `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`, which would get all user names whose path starts with `/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/`.

                This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all user names. This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                A friendly description of the policy.

                Typically used to store information about the permissions defined in the policy. For example, "Grants access to production DynamoDB tables."

                The policy description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.

            path: |-
                The path for the policy.

                For more information about paths, see [IAM identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

                This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

                You cannot use an asterisk (\*) in the path name.
            policy-document: |-
                The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the new policy.

                You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

                The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

                To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see [Grammar of the IAM JSON policy language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

                - Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range
                - The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through `\u00FF`)
                - The special characters tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`)
            policy-name: |-
                The friendly name of the policy.

                IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
            tags: |-
                A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM customer managed policy. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

            Deletes the specified managed policy.

            Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:

            - Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using [DetachUserPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DetachUserPolicy.html), [DetachGroupPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DetachGroupPolicy.html), or [DetachRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DetachRolePolicy.html). To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use [ListEntitiesForPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListEntitiesForPolicy.html).
            - Delete all versions of the policy using [DeletePolicyVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicyVersion.html). To list the policy's versions, use [ListPolicyVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListPolicyVersions.html). You cannot use [DeletePolicyVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicyVersion.html) to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process.
            - Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default version) using this operation.

            For information about managed policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM role's permissions boundary. You can use an Amazon Web Services managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a role. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the role can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the role.

            You cannot set the boundary for a service-linked role.

            Policies used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the role. To learn how the effective permissions for a role are evaluated, see [IAM JSON policy evaluation logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html) in the IAM User Guide.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Adds one or more tags to an IAM role. The role can be a regular role or a service-linked role. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM role that has a specified tag attached. You can also restrict access to only those resources that have a certain tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - **Cost allocation** - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams are using which Amazon Web Services resources.

            <!--THE END-->

            - If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

            For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Retrieves the user name for the specified IAM user. A login profile is created when you create a password for the user to access the Amazon Web Services Management Console. If the user does not exist or does not have a password, the operation returns a 404 (`NoSuchEntity`) error.

            If you create an IAM user with access to the console, the `CreateDate` reflects the date you created the initial password for the user.

            If you create an IAM user with programmatic access, and then later add a password for the user to access the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the `CreateDate` reflects the initial password creation date. A user with programmatic access does not have a login profile unless you create a password for the user to access the Amazon Web Services Management Console.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            marker: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the `Marker` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
            max-items: |-
                Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            server-certificate-name: |-
                The name of the IAM server certificate whose tags you want to see.

                This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: \_+=,.@-
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM group.

            A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a group, use [`AttachGroupPolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AttachGroupPolicy.html) . To create a new managed policy, use [`CreatePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html) . For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a group, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `PutGroupPolicy`.

If a temporary access key is used, then `UserName` is required. If a long-term key is assigned to the user, then `UserName` is not required.

            This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. If the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users, the root user returns it's own access key IDs by running this command.

            To ensure the security of your Amazon Web Services account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation.

You can remove the existing role and then add a different role to an instance profile. You must then wait for the change to appear across all of Amazon Web Services because of [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). To force the change, you must [disassociate the instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateIamInstanceProfile.html) and then [associate the instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateIamInstanceProfile.html), or you can stop your instance and then restart it.

            The caller of this operation must be granted the `PassRole` permission on the IAM role by a permissions policy.

            When using the [iam:AssociatedResourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#available-keys-for-iam) condition in a policy to restrict the [PassRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html) IAM action, special considerations apply if the policy is intended to define access for the `AddRoleToInstanceProfile` action. In this case, you cannot specify a Region or instance ID in the EC2 instance ARN. The ARN value must be `arn:aws:ec2:*:CallerAccountId:instance/*`. Using any other ARN value may lead to unexpected evaluation results.

            For more information about roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                This flag prevents any party other than the owner from calling `SendDelegationToken` API for this delegation request. This behavior becomes useful when the delegation request owner needs to be present for subsequent partner interactions, but the delegation request was sent to a more privileged user for approval due to the owner lacking sufficient delegation permissions.

            If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.

            The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

            If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use [SimulatePrincipalPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_SimulatePrincipalPolicy.html) instead.

            Context keys are variables that are maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services and which provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the `Condition` element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use [GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy.html).

            If the output is long, you can use `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters to paginate the results.

            The IAM policy simulator evaluates statements in the identity-based policy and the inputs that you provide during simulation. The policy simulator results can differ from your live Amazon Web Services environment. We recommend that you check your policies against your live Amazon Web Services environment after testing using the policy simulator to confirm that you have the desired results.

                The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that an IAM entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. The policy input is specified as a string that contains the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

                The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

                The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

                - Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range
                - The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through `\u00FF`)
                - The special characters tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`)
            policy-input-list: |-
                A list of policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy. Do not include any resource-based policies in this parameter. Any resource-based policy must be submitted with the `ResourcePolicy` parameter. The policies cannot be "scope-down" policies, such as you could include in a call to [GetFederationToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html) or one of the [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API operations. In other words, do not use policies designed to restrict what a user can do while using the temporary credentials.

                The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

            resource-arns: |-
                A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to `*` (all resources). Each API in the `ActionNames` parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

                The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the `ResourcePolicy` parameter.

                If you include a `ResourcePolicy`, then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error.

                For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

                Simulation of resource-based policies isn't supported for IAM roles.
            resource-handling-option: "Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.\n\nEach of the Amazon EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the Amazon EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the Amazon EC2 scenario options, see [Supported platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.\n\n- **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore**\n  \n  instance, image, security group, network interface\n- **EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet**\n  \n  instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet\n- **EC2-VPC-EBS**\n  \n  instance, image, security group, network interface, volume\n- **EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet**\n  \n  instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet, volume"
            resource-owner: |-
                An ARN representing the Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If `ResourceOwner` is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any `ResourcePolicy` included in the simulation. If the `ResourceOwner` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in `CallerArn`. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user `CallerArn`.

                The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: `arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root`. For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: `arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root`.
            resource-policy: |-
                A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation.

                The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

                The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default value of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

                Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the `DurationSeconds` API parameter or the `duration-seconds` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The `MaxSessionDuration` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the `DurationSeconds` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the `DurationSeconds` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.

                A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy can grant to an entity. To learn more, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in the input policies. The policies are supplied as a list of one or more strings. To get the context keys from policies associated with an IAM user, group, or role, use [GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy.html).

            Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value specified in an IAM policy. Use `GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy` to understand what key names and values you must supply when you call [SimulateCustomPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_SimulateCustomPolicy.html).

            Adds one or more tags to an IAM instance profile. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM instance profile that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            <!--THE END-->

            - If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

            If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials. This is true even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.

            For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            To ensure the security of your Amazon Web Services account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.

            Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is `Active`.

            For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see [Managing server certificates in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.

            An IAM group can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a group, use [GetPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html) to determine the policy's default version, then use [GetPolicyVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html) to retrieve the policy document.

                Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.

            Sets the specified version of the global endpoint token as the token version used for the Amazon Web Services account.

            By default, Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at `https://sts.amazonaws.com`. Amazon Web Services recommends using Regional STS endpoints to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token availability. For information about Regional endpoints for STS, see [Security Token Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sts.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

            If you make an STS call to the global endpoint, the resulting session tokens might be valid in some Regions but not others. It depends on the version that is set in this operation. Version 1 tokens are valid only in Amazon Web Services Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens. For information, see [Activating and deactivating STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            To view the current session token version, see the `GlobalEndpointTokenVersion` entry in the response of the [GetAccountSummary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccountSummary.html) operation.

            Adds one or more tags to an OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible identity provider. For more information about these providers, see [About web identity federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc.html). If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM identity-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an OIDC provider that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            <!--THE END-->

            - If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

            Uploads a server certificate entity for the Amazon Web Services account. The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.

            We recommend that you use [Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/) to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to Amazon Web Services resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the [Certificate Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/).

            For more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. This topic includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

            For information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `UploadServerCertificate`. For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see [Signing Amazon Web Services API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

            If a delegation request has no owner or owner account, `GetHumanReadableSummary` for that delegation request can be called by any account. If the owner account is assigned but there is no owner id, only identities within that owner account can call `GetHumanReadableSummary` for the delegation request to retrieve a summary of that request. Once the delegation request is fully owned, the owner of the request gets a default permission to get that delegation request. For more details, read [default permissions granted to delegation requests](). These rules are identical to [GetDelegationRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetDelegationRequest.html) API behavior, such that a party who has permissions to call [GetDelegationRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetDelegationRequest.html) for a given delegation request will always be able to retrieve the human readable summary for that request.

            Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified managed policy, including the policy document.

            Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.

            To list the available versions for a policy, use [ListPolicyVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListPolicyVersions.html).

            This operation retrieves information about managed policies. To retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded in a user, group, or role, use [GetUserPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUserPolicy.html), [GetGroupPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetGroupPolicy.html), or [GetRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetRolePolicy.html).

            Retrieves a list of policies that the IAM identity (user, group, or role) can use to access each specified service.

            This operation does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see [Evaluating policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            The list of policies returned by the operation depends on the ARN of the identity that you provide.

            - **User** – The list of policies includes the managed and inline policies that are attached to the user directly. The list also includes any additional managed and inline policies that are attached to the group to which the user belongs.
            - **Group** – The list of policies includes only the managed and inline policies that are attached to the group directly. Policies that are attached to the group’s user are not included.
            - **Role** – The list of policies includes only the managed and inline policies that are attached to the role.

            For each managed policy, this operation returns the ARN and policy name. For each inline policy, it returns the policy name and the entity to which it is attached. Inline policies do not have an ARN. For more information about these policy types, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Retrieves information about all IAM users, groups, roles, and policies in your Amazon Web Services account, including their relationships to one another. Use this operation to obtain a snapshot of the configuration of IAM permissions (users, groups, roles, and policies) in your account.

            Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.

            You can optionally filter the results using the `Filter` parameter. You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

            Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](http://openid.net/connect/).

            The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.

            If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see [Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:

            - The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust
            - A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider
            - A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM OIDC provider
            - A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses

            You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.

            Amazon Web Services secures communication with OIDC identity providers (IdPs) using our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS certificate. If your OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we secure communication using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.

            The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the [CreateOpenIDConnectProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOpenIDConnectProvider.html) operation to highly privileged users.

                You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider.

                There is no defined format for a client ID. The `CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest` operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.

For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
            thumbprint-list: |-
                A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.

                This parameter is optional. If it is not included, IAM will retrieve and use the top intermediate certificate authority (CA) thumbprint of the OpenID Connect identity provider server certificate.

                The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string.

                For example, assume that the OIDC provider is `server.example.com` and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by `https://keys.server.example.com.`

                For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint, see [Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/identity-providers-oidc-obtain-thumbprint.html) in the *IAM user Guide*.

                The URL of the identity provider. The URL must begin with `https://` and should correspond to the `iss` claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like `https://server.example.org` or `https://example.com`. The URL should not contain a port number.

                You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single Amazon Web Services account. If you try to submit a URL that has already been used for an OpenID Connect provider in the Amazon Web Services account, you will get an error.

            Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.

            An IAM role can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a role, use [GetPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html) to determine the policy's default version, then use [GetPolicyVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html) to retrieve the policy document.

            Retrieves a service last accessed report that was created using the `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` operation. You can use the `JobId` parameter in `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails` to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.

            Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see [Evaluating policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails` operation returns the reason that it failed.

            The `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails` operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report:

            - **User** – Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report
            - **Group** – Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the service
            - **Role** – Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report
            - **Policy** – Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy to attempt to access the service

            By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

            If you specified `ACTION_LEVEL` granularity when you generated the report, this operation returns service and action last accessed data. This includes the most recent access attempt for each tracked action within a service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data.

            For more information about service and action last accessed data, see [Reducing permissions using service last accessed data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

            Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.

            The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

            Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate *does* change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.

            Amazon Web Services secures communication with OIDC identity providers (IdPs) using our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS certificate. If your OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we secure communication using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.

            Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the `UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint` operation to highly privileged users.

            You cannot set the boundary for a service-linked role.

            Deleting the permissions boundary for a role might increase its permissions. For example, it might allow anyone who assumes the role to perform all the actions granted in its permissions policies.

            For more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

            If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the certificate. For more information, see [DeleteLoadBalancerListeners](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteLoadBalancerListeners.html) in the *Elastic Load Balancing API Reference*.

            Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.

            The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy. Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the Amazon Web Services Management Console or one that supports API access to Amazon Web Services.

            When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

            This operation requires [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

            For more information, see [Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access the Amazon Web Services Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html) and [About SAML 2.0-based federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.

            When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using [`CreateRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRole.html) . You can update a role's trust policy using [`UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.html) . For more information about roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use [`AttachRolePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AttachRolePolicy.html) . To create a new managed policy, use [`CreatePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html) . For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `PutRolePolicy`.

You can also include the tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Amazon Web Services Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

            Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.

            An IAM user can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a user, use [GetPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html) to determine the policy's default version. Then use [GetPolicyVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html) to retrieve the policy document.

        command: |-
            Adds one or more tags to an IAM server certificate. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            For certificates in a Region supported by Certificate Manager (ACM), we recommend that you don't use IAM server certificates. Instead, use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. For more information about IAM server certificates, [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only a server certificate that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - **Cost allocation** - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams are using which Amazon Web Services resources.

            <!--THE END-->

            - If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

            Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You can generate a report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization.

            To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information, see [Refining permissions using service last accessed data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity.

            You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP.

            For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see [Reducing permissions using service last accessed data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see [Logging IAM events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            This operation returns a `JobId`. Use this parameter in the `GetOrganizationsAccessReport` operation to check the status of the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the `JobId` parameter in the `GetOrganizationsAccessReport` operation and test the `JobStatus` response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report.

            To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report.

            - **Root** – When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.
            - **OU** – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.
            - **management account** – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account.
            - **Account** – When you specify another account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account.

            To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service.

            - **Root** – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data.
            - **OU** – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data.
            - **management account** – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account.
            - **Account** – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data.

            Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see [Evaluating policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Adds one or more tags to an IAM customer managed policy. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM customer managed policy that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

For more information about these providers, see [About SAML 2.0-based federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html) . If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only a SAML identity provider that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            <!--THE END-->

            - If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report:\n\n- [GetServiceLastAccessedDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetServiceLastAccessedDetails.html) – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every Amazon Web Services service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt.\n  \n  The `JobId` returned by `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail` must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call `GetServiceLastAccessedDetail`.\n- [GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities.html) – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web Services service.\n\nTo check the status of the `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` request, use the `JobId` parameter in the same operations and test the `JobStatus` response parameter.\n\nFor additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the [ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess.html) operation.\n\nService last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service.

            Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

            You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use [SimulateCustomPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_SimulateCustomPolicy.html) instead.

            You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation for IAM users only.

            The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations.

            **Note:** This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use [SimulateCustomPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_SimulateCustomPolicy.html) instead.

            Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the `Condition` element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use [GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy.html).

            If the output is long, you can use the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters to paginate the results.

            The IAM policy simulator evaluates statements in the identity-based policy and the inputs that you provide during simulation. The policy simulator results can differ from your live Amazon Web Services environment. We recommend that you check your policies against your live Amazon Web Services environment after testing using the policy simulator to confirm that you have the desired results. For more information about using the policy simulator, see [Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify as the simulated caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a `CallerArn`, it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in `PolicySourceArn`, if you specified a user. If you include both a `PolicySourceArn` (for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David`) and a `CallerArn` (for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob`), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies.

                You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

                `CallerArn` is required if you include a `ResourcePolicy` and the `PolicySourceArn` is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource-based policy's `Principal` element has a value to use in evaluating the policy.

                For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

                Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

                If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

Each API in the `ActionNames` parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.

                The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the `ResourcePolicy` parameter.

            resource-owner: An Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If `ResourceOwner` is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any `ResourcePolicy` included in the simulation. If the `ResourceOwner` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in `CallerArn`. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user `CallerArn`.

            For more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

            You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate's path or name. For more information, see [Renaming a server certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs_manage.html#RenamingServerCerts) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named `ProductionCert` to `ProdCert`, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the `ProductionCert` group, but not the `ProdCert` certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see [Access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            Adds one or more tags to an IAM virtual multi-factor authentication (MFA) device. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

            A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

            - **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
            - **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM virtual MFA device that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

            <!--THE END-->

            - If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            - Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

                Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.
