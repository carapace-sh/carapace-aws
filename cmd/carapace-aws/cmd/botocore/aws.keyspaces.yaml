            The `CreateKeyspace` operation adds a new keyspace to your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, keyspace names must be unique within each Region.

            `CreateKeyspace` is an asynchronous operation. You can monitor the creation status of the new keyspace by using the `GetKeyspace` operation.

            For more information, see [Create a keyspace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/getting-started.keyspaces.html) in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

            The `CreateTable` operation adds a new table to the specified keyspace. Within a keyspace, table names must be unique.

            `CreateTable` is an asynchronous operation. When the request is received, the status of the table is set to `CREATING`. You can monitor the creation status of the new table by using the `GetTable` operation, which returns the current `status` of the table. You can start using a table when the status is `ACTIVE`.

                The optional auto scaling settings for a table in provisioned capacity mode. Specifies if the service can manage throughput capacity automatically on your behalf.

                Auto scaling helps you provision throughput capacity for variable workloads efficiently by increasing and decreasing your table's read and write capacity automatically in response to application traffic. For more information, see [Managing throughput capacity automatically with Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/autoscaling.html) in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

                For a multi-Region table in provisioned capacity mode, you can configure the table's read capacity differently for each Region's replica. The write capacity, however, remains synchronized between all replicas to ensure that there's enough capacity to replicate writes across all Regions. To define the read capacity for a table replica in a specific Region, you can do so by configuring the following parameters.

                - `region`: The Region where these settings are applied. (Required)
                - `readCapacityUnits`: The provisioned read capacity units. (Optional)

            Any number of users can execute up to 4 concurrent restores (any type of restore) in a given account.

            When you restore using point in time recovery, Amazon Keyspaces restores your source table's schema and data to the state based on the selected timestamp `(day:hour:minute:second)` to a new table. The Time to Live (TTL) settings are also restored to the state based on the selected timestamp.

            In addition to the table's schema, data, and TTL settings, `RestoreTable` restores the capacity mode, auto scaling settings, encryption settings, and point-in-time recovery settings from the source table. Unlike the table's schema data and TTL settings, which are restored based on the selected timestamp, these settings are always restored based on the table's settings as of the current time or when the table was deleted.

            You can also overwrite these settings during restore:

            - Read/write capacity mode
            - Provisioned throughput capacity units
            - Auto scaling settings
            - Point-in-time (PITR) settings
            - Tags

            Note that the following settings are not restored, and you must configure them manually for the new table:

            - Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
            - Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms

        command: |-
            Adds a new Amazon Web Services Region to the keyspace. You can add a new Region to a keyspace that is either a single or a multi-Region keyspace. Amazon Keyspaces is going to replicate all tables in the keyspace to the new Region. To successfully replicate all tables to the new Region, they must use client-side timestamps for conflict resolution. To enable client-side timestamps, specify `clientSideTimestamps.status = enabled` when invoking the API. For more information about client-side timestamps, see [Client-side timestamps in Amazon Keyspaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/client-side-timestamps.html) in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

            To add a Region to a keyspace using the `UpdateKeyspace` API, the IAM principal needs permissions for the following IAM actions:

            - `cassandra:Alter`
            - `cassandra:AlterMultiRegionResource`
            - `cassandra:Create`
            - `cassandra:CreateMultiRegionResource`
            - `cassandra:Select`
            - `cassandra:SelectMultiRegionResource`
            - `cassandra:Modify`
            - `cassandra:ModifyMultiRegionResource`

            If the keyspace contains a table that is configured in provisioned mode with auto scaling enabled, the following additional IAM actions need to be allowed.

            - `application-autoscaling:RegisterScalableTarget`
            - `application-autoscaling:DeregisterScalableTarget`
            - `application-autoscaling:DescribeScalableTargets`
            - `application-autoscaling:PutScalingPolicy`
            - `application-autoscaling:DescribeScalingPolicies`

            To use the `UpdateKeyspace` API, the IAM principal also needs permissions to create a service-linked role with the following elements:

            - `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` - The **action** the principal can perform.
            - `arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/replication.cassandra.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForKeyspacesReplication` - The **resource** that the action can be performed on.
            - `iam:AWSServiceName: replication.cassandra.amazonaws.com` - The only Amazon Web Services service that this role can be attached to is Amazon Keyspaces.

            For more information, see [Configure the IAM permissions required to add an Amazon Web Services Region to a keyspace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/howitworks_replication_permissions_addReplica.html) in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

            The `ListTables` operation returns a list of tables for a specified keyspace.

            To read keyspace metadata using `ListTables`, the IAM principal needs `Select` action permissions for the system keyspace.

            keyspace-name: The name of the keyspace.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The total number of tables to return in the output. If the total number of tables available is more than the value specified, a `NextToken` is provided in the output. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value as an argument of a subsequent API invocation.
            next-token: The pagination token. To resume pagination, provide the `NextToken` value as an argument of a subsequent API invocation.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
