            Returns the details of the transformer run, based on the Transformer job ID.

            If 30 days have elapsed since your transformer job was started, the system deletes it. So, if you run `GetTransformerJob` and supply a `transformerId` and `transformerJobId` for a job that was started more than 30 days previously, you receive a 404 response.

            Amazon Web Services B2B Data Interchange uses a mapping template in JSONata or XSLT format to transform a customer input file into a JSON or XML file that can be converted to EDI.

            If you provide a sample EDI file with the same structure as the EDI files that you wish to generate, then the service can generate a mapping template. The starter template contains placeholder values which you can replace with JSONata or XSLT expressions to take data from your input file and insert it into the JSON or XML file that is used to generate the EDI.

            If you do not provide a sample EDI file, then the service can generate a mapping template based on the EDI settings in the `templateDetails` parameter.

            Currently, we only support generating a template that can generate the input to produce an Outbound X12 EDI file.

            Creates a transformer. Amazon Web Services B2B Data Interchange currently supports two scenarios:

            - *Inbound EDI*: the Amazon Web Services customer receives an EDI file from their trading partner. Amazon Web Services B2B Data Interchange converts this EDI file into a JSON or XML file with a service-defined structure. A mapping template provided by the customer, in JSONata or XSLT format, is optionally applied to this file to produce a JSON or XML file with the structure the customer requires.
            - *Outbound EDI*: the Amazon Web Services customer has a JSON or XML file containing data that they wish to use in an EDI file. A mapping template, provided by the customer (in either JSONata or XSLT format) is applied to this file to generate a JSON or XML file in the service-defined structure. This file is then converted to an EDI file.
