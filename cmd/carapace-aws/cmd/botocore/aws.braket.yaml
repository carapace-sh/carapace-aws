            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Retrieves the devices available in Amazon Braket.

            For backwards compatibility with older versions of BraketSchemas, OpenQASM information is omitted from GetDevice API calls. To get this information the user-agent needs to present a recent version of the BraketSchemas (1.8.0 or later). The Braket SDK automatically reports this for you. If you do not see OpenQASM results in the GetDevice response when using a Braket SDK, you may need to set AWS\_EXECUTION\_ENV environment variable to configure user-agent. See the code examples provided below for how to do this for the AWS CLI, Boto3, and the Go, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            cli-input-yaml: |-

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: Maximum number of results to return in the response.
            next-token: A token used for pagination of results returned in the response. Use the token returned from the previous request to continue search where the previous request ended.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
