                *Tags* are key-value pairs that help you manage, filter, and search for your DataSync resources.
            task-mode: "Specifies one of the following task modes for your data transfer:\n\n- `ENHANCED` - Transfer virtually unlimited numbers of objects with higher performance than Basic mode. Enhanced mode tasks optimize the data transfer process by listing, preparing, transferring, and verifying data in parallel. Enhanced mode is currently available for transfers between Amazon S3 locations, transfers between Azure Blob and Amazon S3 without an agent, and transfers between other clouds and Amazon S3 without an agent.\n  \n  To create an Enhanced mode task, the IAM role that you use to call the `CreateTask` operation must have the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission.\n- `BASIC` (default) - Transfer files or objects between Amazon Web Services storage and all other supported DataSync locations. Basic mode tasks are subject to [quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/datasync-limits.html) on the number of files, objects, and directories in a dataset. Basic mode sequentially prepares, transfers, and verifies data, making it slower than Enhanced mode for most workloads.\n\nFor more information, see [Understanding task mode differences](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choosing-task-mode.html#task-mode-differences)."
            task-report-config: |-

                When using this parameter, your caller identity (the role that you're using DataSync with) must have the `iam:PassRole` permission. The [AWSDataSyncFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-awsdatasyncfullaccess) policy includes this permission.

                When you include this paramater as part of a `CreateLocationObjectStorage` request, you provide only the KMS key ARN. DataSync uses this KMS key together with the value you specify for the `SecretKey` parameter to create a DataSync-managed secret to store the location access credentials.

                Make sure the DataSync has permission to access the KMS key that you specify.

                You can use either `CmkSecretConfig` (with `SecretKey`) or `CustomSecretConfig` (without `SecretKey`) to provide credentials for a `CreateLocationObjectStorage` request. Do not provide both parameters for the same request.

            server-certificate: |-
                Specifies a certificate chain for DataSync to authenticate with your object storage system if the system uses a private or self-signed certificate authority (CA). You must specify a single `.pem` file with a full certificate chain (for example, `file:///home/user/.ssh/object_storage_certificates.pem`).

                The certificate chain might include:

                - The object storage system's certificate
                - All intermediate certificates (if there are any)
                - The root certificate of the signing CA

                You can concatenate your certificates into a `.pem` file (which can be up to 32768 bytes before base64 encoding). The following example `cat` command creates an `object_storage_certificates.pem` file that includes three certificates:

                `cat object_server_certificate.pem intermediate_certificate.pem ca_root_certificate.pem > object_storage_certificates.pem`

                To use this parameter, configure `ServerProtocol` to `HTTPS`.
            server-hostname: Specifies the domain name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the object storage server that your DataSync agent connects to.

            server-protocol: Specifies the protocol that your object storage server uses to communicate. If not specified, the default value is `HTTPS`.
            subdirectory: Specifies the object prefix for your object storage server. If this is a source location, DataSync only copies objects with this prefix. If this is a destination location, DataSync writes all objects with this prefix.
            tags: Specifies the key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the resource. Tags can help you manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend creating a name tag for your location.

            Creates a transfer *location* for a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage container. DataSync can use this location as a transfer source or destination. You can make transfers with or without a [DataSync agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/creating-azure-blob-location.html#azure-blob-creating-agent) that connects to your container.

            Before you begin, make sure you know [how DataSync accesses Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/creating-azure-blob-location.html#azure-blob-access) and works with [access tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/creating-azure-blob-location.html#azure-blob-access-tiers) and [blob types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/creating-azure-blob-location.html#blob-types).
        flag:
            access-tier: Specifies the access tier that you want your objects or files transferred into. This only applies when using the location as a transfer destination. For more information, see [Access tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/creating-azure-blob-location.html#azure-blob-access-tiers).
            agent-arns: |-
                (Optional) Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DataSync agent that can connect with your Azure Blob Storage container. If you are setting up an agentless cross-cloud transfer, you do not need to specify a value for this parameter.

                You can specify more than one agent. For more information, see [Using multiple agents for your transfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/multiple-agents.html).

                Make sure you configure this parameter correctly when you first create your storage location. You cannot add or remove agents from a storage location after you create it.
            authentication-type: Specifies the authentication method DataSync uses to access your Azure Blob Storage. DataSync can access blob storage using a shared access signature (SAS).
            blob-type: Specifies the type of blob that you want your objects or files to be when transferring them into Azure Blob Storage. Currently, DataSync only supports moving data into Azure Blob Storage as block blobs. For more information on blob types, see the [Azure Blob Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs).

                When you include this paramater as part of a `CreateLocationAzureBlob` request, you provide only the KMS key ARN. DataSync uses this KMS key together with the authentication token you specify for `SasConfiguration` to create a DataSync-managed secret to store the location access credentials.

                Make sure the DataSync has permission to access the KMS key that you specify.

                You can use either `CmkSecretConfig` (with `SasConfiguration`) or `CustomSecretConfig` (without `SasConfiguration`) to provide credentials for a `CreateLocationAzureBlob` request. Do not provide both parameters for the same request.

            Returns a list of DataSync agents that belong to an Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region specified in the request.

            With pagination, you can reduce the number of agents returned in a response. If you get a truncated list of agents in a response, the response contains a marker that you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of agents.

            `ListAgents` is eventually consistent. This means the result of running the operation might not reflect that you just created or deleted an agent. For example, if you create an agent with [CreateAgent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateAgent.html) and then immediately run `ListAgents`, that agent might not show up in the list right away. In situations like this, you can always confirm whether an agent has been created (or deleted) by using [DescribeAgent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_DescribeAgent.html).
