            expires-in: |-
                The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time). Zonal shifts are temporary. You can set a zonal shift to be active initially for up to three days (72 hours).

                If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration. You can also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

                To set a length of time for a zonal shift to be active, specify a whole number, and then one of the following, with no space:

                - **A lowercase letter m:** To specify that the value is in minutes.
                - **A lowercase letter h:** To specify that the value is in hours.

                For example: `20h` means the zonal shift expires in 20 hours. `120m` means the zonal shift expires in 120 minutes (2 hours).

      documentation:
        command: |-
            A practice run configuration for zonal autoshift is required when you enable zonal autoshift. A practice run configuration includes specifications for blocked dates and blocked time windows, and for Amazon CloudWatch alarms that you create to use with practice runs. The alarms that you specify are an *outcome alarm*, to monitor application health during practice runs and, optionally, a *blocking alarm*, to block practice runs from starting.

            When a resource has a practice run configuration, ARC starts zonal shifts for the resource weekly, to shift traffic for practice runs. Practice runs help you to ensure that shifting away traffic from an Availability Zone during an autoshift is safe for your application.

            For more information, see [Considerations when you configure zonal autoshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.considerations.html) in the Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
        flag:
            allowed-windows: |-
                Optionally, you can allow ARC to start practice runs for specific windows of days and times.

                The format for allowed windows is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple allowed windows with spaces.

                For example, say you want to allow practice runs only on Wednesdays and Fridays from noon to 5 p.m. For this scenario, you could set the following recurring days and times as allowed windows, for example: `Wed-12:00-Wed:17:00 Fri-12:00-Fri:17:00`.

                The `allowedWindows` have to start and end on the same day. Windows that span multiple days aren't supported.
            blocked-dates: |-
                Optionally, you can block ARC from starting practice runs for a resource on specific calendar dates.

                The format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Separate multiple blocked dates with spaces.

                For example, if you have an application update scheduled to launch on May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs to shift traffic away at that time, you could set a blocked date for `2024-05-01`.
            blocked-windows: |-
                Optionally, you can block ARC from starting practice runs for specific windows of days and times.

Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple blocked windows with spaces.

                For example, say you run business report summaries three days a week. For this scenario, you could set the following recurring days and times as blocked windows, for example: `Mon:00:00-Mon:10:00 Wed-20:30-Wed:21:30 Fri-20:30-Fri:21:30`.

                Configure one or more of these alarms to monitor the health of your application when traffic is shifted away from an Availability Zone during each practice run. You should configure these alarms to go into an `ALARM` state if you want to stop a zonal shift, to let traffic for the resource return to the original Availability Zone.

            When you start a zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no longer routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is created immediately in ARC. However, it can take a short time, typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in the Availability Zone to complete.

            For more information, see [Zonal shift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.html) in the Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
        flag:
            away-from: The Availability Zone (for example, `use1-az1`) that traffic is moved away from for a resource when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead moved to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.

                The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time). Zonal shifts are temporary. You can set a zonal shift to be active initially for up to three days (72 hours).

                If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration. You can also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

                To set a length of time for a zonal shift to be active, specify a whole number, and then one of the following, with no space:

                - **A lowercase letter m:** To specify that the value is in minutes.
                - **A lowercase letter h:** To specify that the value is in hours.

                For example: `20h` means the zonal shift expires in 20 hours. `120m` means the zonal shift expires in 120 minutes (2 hours).

            The zonal autoshift configuration for a resource includes the practice run configuration and the status for running autoshifts, zonal autoshift status. When a resource has a practice run configuration, ARC starts weekly zonal shifts for the resource, to shift traffic away from an Availability Zone. Weekly practice runs help you to make sure that your application can continue to operate normally with the loss of one Availability Zone.

            You can update the zonal autoshift status to enable or disable zonal autoshift. When zonal autoshift is `ENABLED`, you authorize Amazon Web Services to shift away resource traffic for an application from an Availability Zone during events, on your behalf, to help reduce time to recovery. Traffic is also shifted away for the required weekly practice runs.

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The number of objects that you want to return with this call.
            next-token: Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a `nextToken` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's `nextToken` response to request the next page of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-identifier: The identifier for the resource that you want to list zonal shifts for. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            status: |-
                A status for a zonal shift.

                The `Status` for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

                - **ACTIVE**: The zonal shift has been started and is active.
                - **EXPIRED**: The zonal shift has expired (the expiry time was exceeded).
                - **CANCELED**: The zonal shift was canceled.

            Update the status of autoshift observer notification. Autoshift observer notification enables you to be notified, through Amazon EventBridge, when there is an autoshift event for zonal autoshift.

            If the status is `ENABLED`, ARC includes all autoshift events when you use the EventBridge pattern `Autoshift In Progress`. When the status is `DISABLED`, ARC includes only autoshift events for autoshifts when one or more of your resources is included in the autoshift.

            allowed-windows: |-
                Add, change, or remove windows of days and times for when you can, optionally, allow ARC to start a practice run for a resource.

                The format for allowed windows is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple allowed windows with spaces.

                For example, say you want to allow practice runs only on Wednesdays and Fridays from noon to 5 p.m. For this scenario, you could set the following recurring days and times as allowed windows, for example: `Wed-12:00-Wed:17:00 Fri-12:00-Fri:17:00`.

                The `allowedWindows` have to start and end on the same day. Windows that span multiple days aren't supported.

                Add, change, or remove blocked dates for a practice run in zonal autoshift.

                Optionally, you can block practice runs for specific calendar dates. The format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Separate multiple blocked dates with spaces.

                For example, if you have an application update scheduled to launch on May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs to shift traffic away at that time, you could set a blocked date for `2024-05-01`.

                For example, say you run business report summaries three days a week. For this scenario, you might set the following recurring days and times as blocked windows, for example: `MON-20:30-21:30 WED-20:30-21:30 FRI-20:30-21:30`.
