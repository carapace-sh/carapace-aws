            Transfers a domain from the current Amazon Web Services account to another Amazon Web Services account. Note the following:

            - The Amazon Web Services account that you're transferring the domain to must accept the transfer. If the other account doesn't accept the transfer within 3 days, we cancel the transfer. See [AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount.html).
            - You can cancel the transfer before the other account accepts it. See [CancelDomainTransferToAnotherAwsAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_CancelDomainTransferToAnotherAwsAccount.html).
            - The other account can reject the transfer. See [RejectDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_RejectDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount.html).

            When you transfer a domain from one Amazon Web Services account to another, Route 53 doesn't transfer the hosted zone that is associated with the domain. DNS resolution isn't affected if the domain and the hosted zone are owned by separate accounts, so transferring the hosted zone is optional. For information about transferring the hosted zone to another Amazon Web Services account, see [Migrating a Hosted Zone to a Different Amazon Web Services Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-migrating.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

[GetOperationDetail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_GetOperationDetail.html) provides additional information, for example, `Domain Transfer from Aws Account 111122223333 has been cancelled`.

            While some domains may allow different privacy settings per contact, we recommend specifying the same privacy setting for all contacts.

            This operation affects only the contact information for the specified contact type (administrative, registrant, or technical). If the request succeeds, Amazon Route 53 returns an operation ID that you can use with [GetOperationDetail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_GetOperationDetail.html) to track the progress and completion of the action. If the request doesn't complete successfully, the domain registrant will be notified by email.

            By disabling the privacy service via API, you consent to the publication of the contact information provided for this domain via the public WHOIS database. You certify that you are the registrant of this domain name and have the authority to make this decision. You may withdraw your consent at any time by enabling privacy protection using either `UpdateDomainContactPrivacy` or the Route 53 console. Enabling privacy protection removes the contact information provided for this domain from the WHOIS database. For more information on our privacy practices, see [https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/).

            Transfers a domain from another registrar to Amazon Route 53.

            For more information about transferring domains, see the following topics:

            - For transfer requirements, a detailed procedure, and information about viewing the status of a domain that you're transferring to Route 53, see [Transferring Registration for a Domain to Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
            - For information about how to transfer a domain from one Amazon Web Services account to another, see [TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount.html).
            - For information about how to transfer a domain to another domain registrar, see [Transferring a Domain from Amazon Route 53 to Another Registrar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-from-route-53.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

            During the transfer of any country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) to Route 53, except for .cc and .tv, updates to the owner contact are ignored and the owner contact data from the registry is used. You can update the owner contact after the transfer is complete. For more information, see [UpdateDomainContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_UpdateDomainContact.html).

            If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain, we highly recommend that you transfer your DNS service to Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time.

            If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the domain might become unavailable.

            If the transfer is successful, this method returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the transfer doesn't complete successfully, the domain registrant will be notified by email.
        flag:
            admin-contact: Provides detailed contact information.
            auth-code: The authorization code for the domain. You get this value from the current registrar.

                The name of the domain that you want to transfer to Route 53. The top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a list of supported TLDs, see [Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

                The domain name can contain only the following characters:

                - Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.
                - Numbers 0 through 9.
                - Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.
