            Modifies a cluster subnet group to include the specified list of VPC subnets. The operation replaces the existing list of subnets with the new list of subnets.

            VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. If a subnet group for a provisioned cluster is in an account with VPC BPA turned on, the following capabilities are blocked:

            - Creating a public cluster
            - Restoring a public cluster
            - Modifying a private cluster to be public
            - Adding a subnet with VPC BPA turned on to the subnet group when there's at least one public cluster within the group

            For more information about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            To create a cluster in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you must provide a cluster subnet group name. The cluster subnet group identifies the subnets of your VPC that Amazon Redshift uses when creating the cluster. For more information about managing clusters, go to [Amazon Redshift Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*.

            VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. If a subnet group for a provisioned cluster is in an account with VPC BPA turned on, the following capabilities are blocked:

            - Creating a public cluster
            - Restoring a public cluster
            - Modifying a private cluster to be public
            - Adding a subnet with VPC BPA turned on to the subnet group when there's at least one public cluster within the group

            max-records: The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified MaxRecords value, a value is returned in a marker field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Generates an encrypted authentication token that propagates the caller's Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center identity to Amazon Redshift clusters. This API extracts the Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center identity from enhanced credentials and creates a secure token that Amazon Redshift drivers can use for authentication.

            The token is encrypted using Key Management Service (KMS) and can only be decrypted by the specified Amazon Redshift clusters. The token contains the caller's Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center identity information and is valid for a limited time period.

            This API is exclusively for use with Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center enhanced credentials. If the caller is not using enhanced credentials with embedded Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center identity, the API will return an error.

You can add as many as 20 ingress rules to an Amazon Redshift security group.

            If you authorize access to an Amazon EC2 security group, specify *EC2SecurityGroupName* and *EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId*. The Amazon EC2 security group and Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

            If you authorize access to a CIDR/IP address range, specify *CIDRIP*. For an overview of CIDR blocks, see the Wikipedia article on [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

            You must also associate the security group with a cluster so that clients running on these IP addresses or the EC2 instance are authorized to connect to the cluster.

            VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. If a subnet group for a provisioned cluster is in an account with VPC BPA turned on, the following capabilities are blocked:

            - Creating a public cluster
            - Restoring a public cluster
            - Modifying a private cluster to be public
            - Adding a subnet with VPC BPA turned on to the subnet group when there's at least one public cluster within the group

            For more information about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

            cluster-version: |-
                The new version number of the Amazon Redshift engine to upgrade to.

                For major version upgrades, if a non-default cluster parameter group is currently in use, a new cluster parameter group in the cluster parameter group family for the new version must be specified. The new cluster parameter group can be the default for that cluster parameter group family. For more information about parameters and parameter groups, go to [Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-parameter-groups.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*.

                Indicates whether the cluster is encrypted. If the value is encrypted (true) and you provide a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, we encrypt the cluster with the provided `KmsKeyId`. If you don't provide a `KmsKeyId`, we encrypt with the default key.

                If the value is not encrypted (false), then the cluster is decrypted.
            enhanced-vpc-routing: |-
                An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster that uses enhanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more information, see [Enhanced VPC Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-routing.html) in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

                If this option is `true`, enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

                Default: false
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

            maintenance-track-name: The name for the maintenance track that you want to assign for the cluster. This name change is asynchronous. The new track name stays in the `PendingModifiedValues` for the cluster until the next maintenance window. When the maintenance track changes, the cluster is switched to the latest cluster release available for the maintenance track. At this point, the maintenance track name is applied.
            manage-master-password: If `true`, Amazon Redshift uses Secrets Manager to manage this cluster's admin credentials. You can't use `MasterUserPassword` if `ManageMasterPassword` is true. If `ManageMasterPassword` is false or not set, Amazon Redshift uses `MasterUserPassword` for the admin user account's password.
            manual-snapshot-retention-period: |-
                The default for number of days that a newly created manual snapshot is retained. If the value is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely. This value doesn't retroactively change the retention periods of existing manual snapshots.

            master-user-password: |-
                The new password for the cluster admin user. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the `MasterUserPassword` element exists in the `PendingModifiedValues` element of the operation response.

                You can't use `MasterUserPassword` if `ManageMasterPassword` is `true`.

                Operations never return the password, so this operation provides a way to regain access to the admin user account for a cluster if the password is lost.

                Default: Uses existing setting.

                Constraints:

                - Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length.

            Returns information about Amazon Redshift security groups. If the name of a security group is specified, the response will contain only information about only that security group.

            For information about managing security groups, go to [Amazon Redshift Cluster Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-security-groups.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*.

            If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all security groups that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all security groups that have any combination of those values are returned.

            If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, security groups are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.

            Creates a new table from a table in an Amazon Redshift cluster snapshot. You must create the new table within the Amazon Redshift cluster that the snapshot was taken from.

            You cannot use `RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot` to restore a table with the same name as an existing table in an Amazon Redshift cluster. That is, you cannot overwrite an existing table in a cluster with a restored table. If you want to replace your original table with a new, restored table, then rename or drop your original table before you call `RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot`. When you have renamed your original table, then you can pass the original name of the table as the `NewTableName` parameter value in the call to `RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot`. This way, you can replace the original table with the table created from the snapshot.

            You can't use this operation to restore tables with [interleaved sort keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Sorting_data.html#t_Sorting_data-interleaved).

            max-records: |-
                The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified `MaxRecords` value, a value is returned in a `marker` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.

                Default: `100`

        command: |-
            Returns one or more snapshot objects, which contain metadata about your cluster snapshots. By default, this operation returns information about all snapshots of all clusters that are owned by your Amazon Web Services account. No information is returned for snapshots owned by inactive Amazon Web Services accounts.

            If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all snapshots that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all snapshots that have any combination of those values are returned. Only snapshots that you own are returned in the response; shared snapshots are not returned with the tag key and tag value request parameters.

            If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, snapshots are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.

            Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action requires an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an Amazon SNS topic created by either the Amazon Redshift console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console.

            You can specify the source type, and lists of Amazon Redshift source IDs, event categories, and event severities. Notifications will be sent for all events you want that match those criteria. For example, you can specify source type = cluster, source ID = my-cluster-1 and mycluster2, event categories = Availability, Backup, and severity = ERROR. The subscription will only send notifications for those ERROR events in the Availability and Backup categories for the specified clusters.

            If you specify both the source type and source IDs, such as source type = cluster and source identifier = my-cluster-1, notifications will be sent for all the cluster events for my-cluster-1. If you specify a source type but do not specify a source identifier, you will receive notice of the events for the objects of that type in your Amazon Web Services account. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of events generated from all Amazon Redshift sources belonging to your Amazon Web Services account. You must specify a source type if you specify a source ID.

The action returns the database user name prefixed with `IAM:` if `AutoCreate` is `False` or `IAMA:` if `AutoCreate` is `True`. You can optionally specify one or more database user groups that the user will join at log on. By default, the temporary credentials expire in 900 seconds. You can optionally specify a duration between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600 seconds (60 minutes). For more information, see [Using IAM Authentication to Generate Database User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/generating-user-credentials.html) in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

            The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that runs GetClusterCredentials must have an IAM policy attached that allows access to all necessary actions and resources. For more information about permissions, see [Resource Policies for GetClusterCredentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-identity-based.html#redshift-policy-resources.getclustercredentials-resources) in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

            If the `DbGroups` parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow the `redshift:JoinGroup` action with access to the listed `dbgroups`.

            In addition, if the `AutoCreate` parameter is set to `True`, then the policy must include the `redshift:CreateClusterUser` permission.

            If the `DbName` parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow access to the resource `dbname` for the specified database name.

            The following are limitations for `DescribeTags`:

            - You cannot specify an ARN and a resource-type value together in the same request.
            - You cannot use the `MaxRecords` and `Marker` parameters together with the ARN parameter.

For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all resources that have any combination of those values are returned.

            If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, resources are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.

            Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. By default, Amazon Redshift creates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the original cluster from which the snapshot was created, except that the new cluster is created with the default cluster security and parameter groups. After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the [ModifyCluster]() API to associate a different security group and different parameter group with the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size during restore.

            If you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet group where you want the cluster restored.

            VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. If a subnet group for a provisioned cluster is in an account with VPC BPA turned on, the following capabilities are blocked:

            - Creating a public cluster
            - Restoring a public cluster
            - Modifying a private cluster to be public
            - Adding a subnet with VPC BPA turned on to the subnet group when there's at least one public cluster within the group

            For more information about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

You can also provide the key ID when you restore from an unencrypted snapshot to an encrypted cluster in the same account. Additionally, you can specify a new KMS key ID when you restore from an encrypted snapshot in the same account in order to change it. In that case, the restored cluster is encrypted with the new KMS key ID.
            maintenance-track-name: The name of the maintenance track for the restored cluster. When you take a snapshot, the snapshot inherits the `MaintenanceTrack` value from the cluster. The snapshot might be on a different track than the cluster that was the source for the snapshot. For example, suppose that you take a snapshot of a cluster that is on the current track and then change the cluster to be on the trailing track. In this case, the snapshot and the source cluster are on different tracks.
            manage-master-password: If `true`, Amazon Redshift uses Secrets Manager to manage the restored cluster's admin credentials. If `ManageMasterPassword` is false or not set, Amazon Redshift uses the admin credentials the cluster had at the time the snapshot was taken.

                    This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
                cluster-exists: |-
                    A value that indicates whether to return snapshots only for an existing cluster. You can perform table-level restore only by using a snapshot of an existing cluster, that is, a cluster that has not been deleted. Values for this parameter work as follows:

                    - If `ClusterExists` is set to `true`, `ClusterIdentifier` is required.
                    - If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` isn't specified, all snapshots associated with deleted clusters (orphaned snapshots) are returned.
                    - If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` is specified for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster are returned.
                    - If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` is specified for an existing cluster, no snapshots are returned.
                cluster-identifier: The identifier of the cluster which generated the requested snapshots.
                end-time: |-
                    A time value that requests only snapshots created at or before the specified time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the [ISO8601 Wikipedia page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)

                    Example: `2012-07-16T18:00:00Z`
                generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                    If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                    This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
                marker: An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a [DescribeClusterSnapshots]() request exceed the value specified in `MaxRecords`, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the `Marker` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the `Marker` parameter and retrying the request.
                max-items: |-
                    The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                    If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                    To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                    Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                max-records: |-
                    The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified `MaxRecords` value, a value is returned in a `marker` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.

                    Default: `100`

                    Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.
                owner-account: The Amazon Web Services account used to create or copy the snapshot. Use this field to filter the results to snapshots owned by a particular account. To describe snapshots you own, either specify your Amazon Web Services account, or do not specify the parameter.
                page-size: |-
                    The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                    This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                    Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                    This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                snapshot-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot associated with the message to describe cluster snapshots.
                snapshot-identifier: The snapshot identifier of the snapshot about which to return information.
                snapshot-type: |-
                    The type of snapshots for which you are requesting information. By default, snapshots of all types are returned.

                    Valid Values: `automated` | `manual`
                sorting-entities: ""
                start-time: |-
                    A value that requests only snapshots created at or after the specified time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the [ISO8601 Wikipedia page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)

                starting-token: |-
                    A token to specify where to start paginating.
                    This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                    For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
                tag-keys: A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching cluster snapshots that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have snapshots that are tagged with keys called `owner` and `environment`. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the snapshots that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.
                tag-values: A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching cluster snapshots that are associated with the specified tag value or values. For example, suppose that you have snapshots that are tagged with values called `admin` and `test`. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the snapshots that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

        **Overview**

        This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to [Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html).

        Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.

        If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the [Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html).

        If you are a database developer, the [Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html) explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.
