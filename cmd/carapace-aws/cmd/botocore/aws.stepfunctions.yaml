        command: |-
            Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a `taskToken` with a null string.

            This API action isn't logged in CloudTrail.

            Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request).

            Polling with `GetActivityTask` can cause latency in some implementations. See [Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/bp-activity-pollers.html) in the Step Functions Developer Guide.

            Lists all executions of a state machine or a Map Run. You can list all executions related to a state machine by specifying a state machine Amazon Resource Name (ARN), or those related to a Map Run by specifying a Map Run ARN. Using this API action, you can also list all [redriven](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-executions.html) executions.

            You can also provide a state machine [alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-alias.html) ARN or [version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-version.html) ARN to list the executions associated with a specific alias or version.

            Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution first.

            If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.

            This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

            This API action is not supported by `EXPRESS` state machines.

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Map Run that started the child workflow executions. If the `mapRunArn` field is specified, a list of all of the child workflow executions started by a Map Run is returned. For more information, see [Examining Map Run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-examine-map-run.html) in the *Step Functions Developer Guide*.

                You can specify either a `mapRunArn` or a `stateMachineArn`, but not both.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use `nextToken` to obtain further pages of results. The default is 100 and the maximum allowed page size is 1000. A value of 0 uses the default.

                This is only an upper limit. The actual number of results returned per call might be fewer than the specified maximum.
            next-token: If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            redrive-filter: |-
                Sets a filter to list executions based on whether or not they have been redriven.

                For a Distributed Map, `redriveFilter` sets a filter to list child workflow executions based on whether or not they have been redriven.

                If you do not provide a `redriveFilter`, Step Functions returns a list of both redriven and non-redriven executions.

                If you provide a state machine ARN in `redriveFilter`, the API returns a validation exception.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            state-machine-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine whose executions is listed.

                You can specify either a `mapRunArn` or a `stateMachineArn`, but not both.

                You can also return a list of executions associated with a specific [alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-alias.html) or [version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-version.html), by specifying an alias ARN or a version ARN in the `stateMachineArn` parameter.
            status-filter: |-
                If specified, only list the executions whose current execution status matches the given filter.

                If you provide a `PENDING_REDRIVE` statusFilter, you must specify `mapRunArn`. For more information, see [Child workflow execution redrive behaviour](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-map-run.html#redrive-child-workflow-behavior) in the *Step Functions Developer Guide*.

                If you provide a stateMachineArn and a `PENDING_REDRIVE` statusFilter, the API returns a validation exception.

            Provides information about a state machine's definition, its execution role ARN, and configuration. If a Map Run dispatched the execution, this action returns the Map Run Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the response. The state machine returned is the state machine associated with the Map Run.

            This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

                The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use `nextToken` to obtain further pages of results. The default is 100 and the maximum allowed page size is 1000. A value of 0 uses the default.

            next-token: If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            Creates a [version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-version.html) from the current revision of a state machine. Use versions to create immutable snapshots of your state machine. You can start executions from versions either directly or with an alias. To create an alias, use [CreateStateMachineAlias]().

            You can publish up to 1000 versions for each state machine. You must manually delete unused versions using the [DeleteStateMachineVersion]() API action.

            `PublishStateMachineVersion` is an idempotent API. It doesn't create a duplicate state machine version if it already exists for the current revision. Step Functions bases `PublishStateMachineVersion`'s idempotency check on the `stateMachineArn`, `name`, and `revisionId` parameters. Requests with the same parameters return a successful idempotent response. If you don't specify a `revisionId`, Step Functions checks for a previously published version of the state machine's current revision.

            Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (`Task` states), determine to which states to transition next (`Choice` states), stop an execution with an error (`Fail` states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see [Amazon States Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html) in the Step Functions User Guide.

            If you set the `publish` parameter of this API action to `true`, it publishes version `1` as the first revision of the state machine.

            For additional control over security, you can encrypt your data using a **customer-managed key** for Step Functions state machines. You can configure a symmetric KMS key and data key reuse period when creating or updating a **State Machine**. The execution history and state machine definition will be encrypted with the key applied to the State Machine.

            This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

            `CreateStateMachine` is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. `CreateStateMachine`'s idempotency check is based on the state machine `name`, `definition`, `type`, `LoggingConfiguration`, `TracingConfiguration`, and `EncryptionConfiguration` The check is also based on the `publish` and `versionDescription` parameters. If a following request has a different `roleArn` or `tags`, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, `roleArn` and `tags` will not be updated, even if they are different.

You can set your application to call [StartExecution]() with an alias and update the version the alias uses without changing the client's code.

            You can also map an alias to split [StartExecution]() requests between two versions of a state machine. To do this, add a second `RoutingConfig` object in the `routingConfiguration` parameter. You must also specify the percentage of execution run requests each version should receive in both `RoutingConfig` objects. Step Functions randomly chooses which version runs a given execution based on the percentage you specify.

            To create an alias that points to a single version, specify a single `RoutingConfig` object with a `weight` set to 100.

            You can create up to 100 aliases for each state machine. You must delete unused aliases using the [DeleteStateMachineAlias]() API action.

            `CreateStateMachineAlias` is an idempotent API. Step Functions bases the idempotency check on the `stateMachineArn`, `description`, `name`, and `routingConfiguration` parameters. Requests that contain the same values for these parameters return a successful idempotent response without creating a duplicate resource.

        command: |-
            Restarts unsuccessful executions of Standard workflows that didn't complete successfully in the last 14 days. These include failed, aborted, or timed out executions. When you [redrive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-executions.html) an execution, it continues the failed execution from the unsuccessful step and uses the same input. Step Functions preserves the results and execution history of the successful steps, and doesn't rerun these steps when you redrive an execution. Redriven executions use the same state machine definition and execution ARN as the original execution attempt.

            For workflows that include an [Inline Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-map-state.html) or [Parallel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-parallel-state.html) state, `RedriveExecution` API action reschedules and redrives only the iterations and branches that failed or aborted.

            To redrive a workflow that includes a Distributed Map state whose Map Run failed, you must redrive the [parent workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/use-dist-map-orchestrate-large-scale-parallel-workloads.html#dist-map-orchestrate-parallel-workloads-key-terms). The parent workflow redrives all the unsuccessful states, including a failed Map Run. If a Map Run was not started in the original execution attempt, the redriven parent workflow starts the Map Run.

            This API action is not supported by `EXPRESS` state machines.

            However, you can restart the unsuccessful executions of Express child workflows in a Distributed Map by redriving its Map Run. When you redrive a Map Run, the Express child workflows are rerun using the [StartExecution]() API action. For more information, see [Redriving Map Runs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-map-run.html).

            You can redrive executions if your original execution meets the following conditions:

            - The execution status isn't `SUCCEEDED`.
            - Your workflow execution has not exceeded the redrivable period of 14 days. Redrivable period refers to the time during which you can redrive a given execution. This period starts from the day a state machine completes its execution.
            - The workflow execution has not exceeded the maximum open time of one year. For more information about state machine quotas, see [Quotas related to state machine executions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/limits-overview.html#service-limits-state-machine-executions).
            - The execution event history count is less than 24,999. Redriven executions append their event history to the existing event history. Make sure your workflow execution contains less than 24,999 events to accommodate the `ExecutionRedriven` history event and at least one other history event.

            The `TestState` API can run for up to five minutes. If the execution of a state exceeds this duration, it fails with the `States.Timeout` error.

            `TestState` only supports the following when a mock is specified: [Activity tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-activities.html), `.sync` or `.waitForTaskToken` [service integration patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html), [Parallel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-parallel-state.html), or [Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-map-state.html) states.

            inspection-level: |-
                Determines the values to return when a state is tested. You can specify one of the following types:

                - `INFO`: Shows the final state output. By default, Step Functions sets `inspectionLevel` to `INFO` if you don't specify a level.
                - `DEBUG`: Shows the final state output along with the input and output data processing result.
                - `TRACE`: Shows the HTTP request and response for an HTTP Task. This level also shows the final state output along with the input and output data processing result.

                Each of these levels also provide information about the status of the state execution and the next state to transition to.
            mock: |-
                Defines a mocked result or error for the state under test.

                A mock can only be specified for Task, Map, or Parallel states. If it is specified for another state type, an exception will be thrown.
            reveal-secrets: |-
                Specifies whether or not to include secret information in the test result. For HTTP Tasks, a secret includes the data that an EventBridge connection adds to modify the HTTP request headers, query parameters, and body. Step Functions doesn't omit any information included in the state definition or the HTTP response.

                If you set `revealSecrets` to `true`, you must make sure that the IAM user that calls the `TestState` API has permission for the `states:RevealSecrets` action. For an example of IAM policy that sets the `states:RevealSecrets` permission, see [IAM permissions to test a state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/test-state-isolation.html#test-state-permissions). Without this permission, Step Functions throws an access denied error.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the `GetActivityTask` API action and respond using `SendTask*` API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.

            This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

            `CreateActivity` is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. `CreateActivity`'s idempotency check is based on the activity `name`. If a following request has different `tags` values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, `tags` will not be updated, even if they are different.

            You can validate that a state machine definition is correct without creating a state machine resource.

            Suggested uses for `ValidateStateMachineDefinition`:

            - Integrate automated checks into your code review or Continuous Integration (CI) process to check state machine definitions before starting deployments.
            - Run validation from a Git pre-commit hook to verify the definition before committing to your source repository.

            Validation will look for problems in your state machine definition and return a **result** and a list of **diagnostic elements**.

            The **result** value will be `OK` when your workflow definition can be successfully created or updated. Note the result can be `OK` even when diagnostic warnings are present in the response. The **result** value will be `FAIL` when the workflow definition contains errors that would prevent you from creating or updating your state machine.

            The list of [ValidateStateMachineDefinitionDiagnostic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_ValidateStateMachineDefinitionDiagnostic.html) data elements can contain zero or more **WARNING** and/or **ERROR** elements.

            The **ValidateStateMachineDefinition API** might add new diagnostics in the future, adjust diagnostic codes, or change the message wording. Your automated processes should only rely on the value of the **result** field value (OK, FAIL). Do **not** rely on the exact order, count, or wording of diagnostic messages.

Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

        Step Functions

        With Step Functions, you can create workflows, also called *state machines*, to build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices, and create data and machine learning pipelines.

        Through the Step Functions API, you can create, list, update, and delete state machines, activities, and other data types. You can start, stop, and redrive your state machines. Your activity workers can send task success, heartbeat, and failure responses.

        With API calls, you can also manage other aspects of your workflow, such as tags, versions, and aliases.

        For more information about developing solutions with Step Functions, see the [*Step Functions Developer Guide*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) .

        If you use the Step Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal case. For example, you might use Step Functions API action `startSyncExecution` and specify its parameter as `StateMachineArn`.
