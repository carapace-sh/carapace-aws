Note that setting the step timeout has no effect on the in progress timeout that may have been specified when the job was created (`CreateJob` using field `timeoutConfig`).

If the version of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match, the update is rejected with a VersionMismatch error, and an ErrorResponse that contains the current job execution status data is returned.

Note that setting or resetting the step timeout has no effect on the in progress timeout that may have been specified when the job was created (`CreateJob` using field `timeoutConfig`).

                Valid values for this parameter range from 1 to 10080 (1 minute to 7 days). A value of -1 is also valid and will cancel the current step timer (created by an earlier use of `UpdateJobExecutionRequest`).
