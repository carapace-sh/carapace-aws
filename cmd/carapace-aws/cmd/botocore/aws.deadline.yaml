                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages.
            next-token: The token for the next set of results, or `null` to start from the beginning.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages.
            next-token: The token for the next set of results, or `null` to start from the beginning.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.

                Deadline Cloud limits the number of workers to less than or equal to the fleet's maximum worker count. The service maintains eventual consistency for the worker count. If you make multiple rapid calls to `CreateWorker` before the field updates, you might exceed your fleet's maximum worker count. For example, if your `maxWorkerCount` is 10 and you currently have 9 workers, making two quick `CreateWorker` calls might successfully create 2 workers instead of 1, resulting in 11 total workers.

            Deadline Cloud limits the number of workers to less than or equal to the fleet's maximum worker count. The service maintains eventual consistency for the worker count. If you make multiple rapid calls to `CreateWorker` before the field updates, you might exceed your fleet's maximum worker count. For example, if your `maxWorkerCount` is 10 and you currently have 9 workers, making two quick `CreateWorker` calls might successfully create 2 workers instead of 1, resulting in 11 total workers.
