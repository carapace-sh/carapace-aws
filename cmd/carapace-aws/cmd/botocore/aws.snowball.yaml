        command: |-
            Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file associated with the specified `JobId` value. You can access the manifest file for up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make another call to the `GetJobManifest` action.

            The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job enters the `WithCustomer` status. This is the only valid status for calling this API as the manifest and `UnlockCode` code value are used for securing your device and should only be used when you have the device. The manifest is decrypted by using the `UnlockCode` code value, when you pass both values to the Snow device through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.

            As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an `UnlockCode` value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snow device associated with that job.

            The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and unlock code, expire 360 days after the job is created.

            Returns the `UnlockCode` code value for the specified job. A particular `UnlockCode` value can be accessed for up to 360 days after the associated job has been created.

            The `UnlockCode` value is a 29-character code with 25 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. This code is used to decrypt the manifest file when it is passed along with the manifest to the Snow device through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. The only valid status for calling this API is `WithCustomer` as the manifest and `Unlock` code values are used for securing your device and should only be used when you have the device.

            As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of the `UnlockCode` in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snow device associated with that job.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

            shipping-option: |-
                The shipping speed for this job. This speed doesn't dictate how soon you'll get the Snow device, rather it represents how quickly the Snow device moves to its destination while in transit. Regional shipping speeds are as follows:

                - In Australia, you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in about a day.
                - In the European Union (EU), you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typically takes less than a week, one way.
                - In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven days.
                - In the US, you have access to one-day shipping and two-day shipping.
            snowball-capacity-preference: |-
                If your job is being created in one of the US regions, you have the option of specifying what size Snow device you'd like for this job. In all other regions, Snowballs come with 80 TB in storage capacity.

    command: The Amazon Web Services Snow Family provides a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow Family commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the Amazon Web Services Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow Family device. To transfer data locally with a Snow Family device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or OpsHub for Snow Family.
