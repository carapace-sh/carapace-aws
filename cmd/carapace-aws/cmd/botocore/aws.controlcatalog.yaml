            Returns details about a specific control, most notably a list of Amazon Web Services Regions where this control is supported. Input a value for the *ControlArn* parameter, in ARN form. `GetControl` accepts *controltower* or *controlcatalog* control ARNs as input. Returns a *controlcatalog* ARN format.

            In the API response, controls that have the value `GLOBAL` in the `Scope` field do not show the `DeployableRegions` field, because it does not apply. Controls that have the value `REGIONAL` in the `Scope` field return a value for the `DeployableRegions` field, as shown in the example.

            max-results: The maximum number of results on a page or for an API request call.
            next-token: The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
