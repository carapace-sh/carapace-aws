        Amazon Elasticsearch Configuration Service

        Use the Amazon Elasticsearch Configuration API to create, configure, and manage Elasticsearch domains.

        For sample code that uses the Configuration API, see the [Amazon Elasticsearch Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-configuration-samples.html). The guide also contains [sample code for sending signed HTTP requests to the Elasticsearch APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-request-signing.html).

        The endpoint for configuration service requests is region-specific: es.*region*.amazonaws.com. For example, es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticsearch-service-regions).
