            Initiates a signing job to be performed on the code provided. Signing jobs are viewable by the `ListSigningJobs` operation for two years after they are performed. Note the following requirements:

            - You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more information, see [Creating a Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the *Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide*.
            - Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.
            - You must create an S3 destination bucket. AWS Signer uses your S3 destination bucket to write your signed code.
            - You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the `StartSigningJob` operation.
            - You must ensure the S3 buckets are from the same Region as the signing profile. Cross-Region signing isn't supported.
            - You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to Signer.

            You can call the [DescribeSigningJob]() and the [ListSigningJobs]() actions after you call `StartSigningJob`.

            For a Java example that shows how to use this action, see [StartSigningJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/api-startsigningjob.html).

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.

        AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code.

        Signer supports the following applications:

        With code signing for AWS Lambda, you can sign [AWS Lambda](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/) deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for [Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/), [Amazon CloudWatch](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/), and [AWS CloudTrail](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/). In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3.

        With code signing for IoT, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for [Amazon FreeRTOS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/) and [AWS IoT Device Management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/), and is integrated with [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/). In order to sign code, you import a third-party code-signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management.

        With Signer and the Notation CLI from the [Notary          Project](https://notaryproject.dev/), you can sign container images stored in a container registry such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The signatures are stored in the registry alongside the images, where they are available for verifying image authenticity and integrity.

        For more information about Signer, see the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).
