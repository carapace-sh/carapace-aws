            Deletes the specified cluster. The cluster transitions to the `INACTIVE` state. Clusters with an `INACTIVE` status might remain discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future. We don't recommend that you rely on `INACTIVE` clusters persisting.

            You must deregister all container instances from this cluster before you may delete it. You can list the container instances in a cluster with [ListContainerInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListContainerInstances.html) and deregister them with [DeregisterContainerInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterContainerInstance.html).

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of service results that `ListServicesByNamespace` returns in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListServicesByNamespace` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListServicesByNamespace` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListServicesByNamespace` returns up to 10 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            namespace: |-
                The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Cloud Map namespace to list the services in.

                Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            next-token: The `nextToken` value that's returned from a `ListServicesByNamespace` request. It indicates that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls are needed. If `maxResults` is returned, it is possible the number of results is less than `maxResults`.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

When a task definition revision is not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.\n\nFor services using the rolling update (`ECS`) you can update the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers, service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task definition. When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the new configuration.\n\nYou can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when starting or running a task, or when creating or updating a service. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html#ebs-volume-types) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. You can update your volume configurations and trigger a new deployment. `volumeConfigurations` is only supported for REPLICA service and not DAEMON service. If you leave `volumeConfigurations` `null`, it doesn't trigger a new deployment. For more information on volumes, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html#ebs-volume-types) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n\nFor services using the blue/green (`CODE_DEPLOY`) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment. For more information, see [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html) in the *CodeDeploy API Reference*.\n\nFor services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, create a new task set For more information, see [CreateTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTaskSet.html).\n\nYou can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new `desiredCount` parameter.\n\nYou can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when starting or running a task, or when creating or updating a service. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html#ebs-volume-types) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n\nIf you have updated the container image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.\n\nIf your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, `my_image:latest`), you don't need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the `forceNewDeployment` option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.\n\nYou can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, `minimumHealthyPercent` and `maximumPercent`, to determine the deployment strategy.\n\n- If `minimumHealthyPercent` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore `desiredCount` temporarily during a deployment. For example, if `desiredCount` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.\n- The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment. You can use it to define the deployment batch size. For example, if `desiredCount` is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).\n\nWhen [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html) stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of `docker stop` is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a `SIGTERM` and a 30-second timeout. After this, `SIGKILL` is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the `SIGTERM` gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no `SIGKILL` is sent.\n\nWhen the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic.\n\n- Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition. For example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.\n- By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a different placement strategy.\n  \n  - Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.\n  - Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.\n\nWhen the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:\n\n- Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.\n- Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service."

This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.

                If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in the grace period might be stopped to reach the desired count.

                This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
            load-balancers: |-
                You must have a service-linked role when you update this property

                A list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It contains the load balancer name, the container name, and the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name is as it appears in a container definition.

                When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration, and then stops the old tasks when the new tasks are running.

                For services that use rolling updates, you can add, update, or remove Elastic Load Balancing target groups. You can update from a single target group to multiple target groups and from multiple target groups to a single target group.

                For services that use blue/green deployments, you can update Elastic Load Balancing target groups by using `CreateDeployment` through CodeDeploy. Note that multiple target groups are not supported for blue/green deployments. For more information see [Register multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                For services that use the external deployment controller, you can add, update, or remove load balancers by using [CreateTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTaskSet.html). Note that multiple target groups are not supported for external deployments. For more information see [Register multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                You can remove existing `loadBalancers` by passing an empty list.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            network-configuration: |-
                An object representing the network configuration for the service.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            placement-constraints: |-
                An array of task placement constraint objects to update the service to use. If no value is specified, the existing placement constraints for the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override any existing placement constraints defined for the service. To remove all existing placement constraints, specify an empty array.

                You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime.

                This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
            placement-strategy: |-
                The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use. If no value is specified, the existing placement strategy for the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override the existing placement strategy defined for the service. To remove an existing placement strategy, specify an empty object.

                You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules for each service.

                This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
            platform-version: |-
                The platform version that your tasks in the service run on. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If a platform version is not specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used. For more information, see [Fargate Platform Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            propagate-tags: |-
                Determines whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated.

                Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To update the tags on all tasks, set `forceNewDeployment` to `true`, so that Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated tags.

                This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
            service: The name of the service to update.
            service-connect-configuration: |-
                The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.

                Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            service-registries: |-
                You must have a service-linked role when you update this property.

                For more information about the role see the `CreateService` request parameter [`role`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html#ECS-CreateService-request-role) .

                The details for the service discovery registries to assign to this service. For more information, see [Service Discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html).

                When you add, update, or remove the service registries configuration, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated service registries configuration, and then stops the old tasks when the new tasks are running.

                You can remove existing `serviceRegistries` by passing an empty list.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            task-definition: |-
                The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` is not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used. If you modify the task definition with `UpdateService`, Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new version is running.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            volume-configurations: |-
                The details of the volume that was `configuredAtLaunch`. You can configure the size, volumeType, IOPS, throughput, snapshot and encryption in [ServiceManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration.html). The `name` of the volume must match the `name` from the task definition. If set to null, no new deployment is triggered. Otherwise, if this configuration differs from the existing one, it triggers a new deployment.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
            vpc-lattice-configurations: |-
                An object representing the VPC Lattice configuration for the service being updated.

                This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

                The path on the container that the Application Load Balancer uses for health checks. This should be a valid HTTP endpoint that returns a successful response (HTTP 200) when the application is healthy.

                If not specified, the default health check path is `/ping`. The health check path must start with a forward slash and can include query parameters. Examples: `/health`, `/api/status`, `/ping?format=json`.
            infrastructure-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure role that grants Amazon ECS permission to create and manage Amazon Web Services resources on your behalf for the Express service. This role is used to provision and manage Application Load Balancers, target groups, security groups, auto-scaling policies, and other Amazon Web Services infrastructure components.

                The infrastructure role must include permissions for Elastic Load Balancing, Application Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2 (for security groups), and other services required for managed infrastructure. This role is only used during Express service creation, updates, and deletion operations.
            memory: The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. This parameter determines the memory allocation for each task in the Express service. The default value for an express service is 512 MiB.
            network-configuration: |-
                The network configuration for the Express service tasks. This specifies the VPC subnets and security groups for the tasks.

                For Express services, you can specify custom security groups and subnets. If not provided, Amazon ECS will use the default VPC configuration and create appropriate security groups automatically. The network configuration determines how your service integrates with your VPC and what network access it has.
            primary-container: |-
                The primary container configuration for the Express service. This defines the main application container that will receive traffic from the Application Load Balancer.

                The primary container must specify at minimum a container image. You can also configure the container port (defaults to 80), logging configuration, environment variables, secrets, and startup commands. The container image can be from Amazon ECR, Docker Hub, or any other container registry accessible to your execution role.
            scaling-target: |-
                The auto-scaling configuration for the Express service. This defines how the service automatically adjusts the number of running tasks based on demand.

                You can specify the minimum and maximum number of tasks, the scaling metric (CPU utilization, memory utilization, or request count per target), and the target value for the metric. If not specified, the default target value for an Express service is 60.
            service-name: |-
                The name of the Express service. This name must be unique within the specified cluster and can contain up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. The name is used to identify the service in the Amazon ECS console and API operations.

                If you don't specify a service name, Amazon ECS generates a unique name for the service. The service name becomes part of the service ARN and cannot be changed after the service is created.
            tags: The metadata that you apply to the Express service to help categorize and organize it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You can apply up to 50 tags to a service.
            task-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that containers in this task can assume. This role allows your application code to access other Amazon Web Services services securely.

                The task role is different from the execution role. While the execution role is used by the Amazon ECS agent to set up the task, the task role is used by your application code running inside the container to make Amazon Web Services API calls. If your application doesn't need to access Amazon Web Services services, you can omit this parameter.

        command: |-
            Updates the protection status of a task. You can set `protectionEnabled` to `true` to protect your task from termination during scale-in events from [Service Autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html) or [deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html).

            Task-protection, by default, expires after 2 hours at which point Amazon ECS clears the `protectionEnabled` property making the task eligible for termination by a subsequent scale-in event.

            You can specify a custom expiration period for task protection from 1 minute to up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours). To specify the custom expiration period, set the `expiresInMinutes` property. The `expiresInMinutes` property is always reset when you invoke this operation for a task that already has `protectionEnabled` set to `true`. You can keep extending the protection expiration period of a task by invoking this operation repeatedly.

            To learn more about Amazon ECS task protection, see [Task scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

            This operation is only supported for tasks belonging to an Amazon ECS service. Invoking this operation for a standalone task will result in an `TASK_NOT_VALID` failure. For more information, see [API failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/api_failures_messages.html).

            If you prefer to set task protection from within the container, we recommend using the [Task scale-in protection endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection-endpoint.html).

            Deletes the specified capacity provider.

            The `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers are reserved and can't be deleted. You can disassociate them from a cluster using either [PutClusterCapacityProviders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutClusterCapacityProviders.html) or by deleting the cluster.

            Prior to a capacity provider being deleted, the capacity provider must be removed from the capacity provider strategy from all services. The [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html) API can be used to remove a capacity provider from a service's capacity provider strategy. When updating a service, the `forceNewDeployment` option can be used to ensure that any tasks using the Amazon EC2 instance capacity provided by the capacity provider are transitioned to use the capacity from the remaining capacity providers. Only capacity providers that aren't associated with a cluster can be deleted. To remove a capacity provider from a cluster, you can either use [PutClusterCapacityProviders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutClusterCapacityProviders.html) or delete the cluster.

If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you can't delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html).

            When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from `ACTIVE` to `DRAINING`, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the [ListServices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListServices.html) API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either `STOPPING` or `STOPPED` status, the service status moves from `DRAINING` to `INACTIVE`. Services in the `DRAINING` or `INACTIVE` status can still be viewed with the [DescribeServices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeServices.html) API operation. However, in the future, `INACTIVE` services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and [DescribeServices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeServices.html) calls on those services return a `ServiceNotFoundException` error.

            If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either `ACTIVE` or `DRAINING` status, you receive an error.

            Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance.

            Once a container instance has reached an `ACTIVE` state, you can change the status of a container instance to `DRAINING` to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.

            A container instance can't be changed to `DRAINING` until it has reached an `ACTIVE` status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.

            When you set a container instance to `DRAINING`, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the `PENDING` state are stopped immediately.

            Service tasks on the container instance that are in the `RUNNING` state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, `minimumHealthyPercent` and `maximumPercent`. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html).

            - If `minimumHealthyPercent` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore `desiredCount` temporarily during task replacement. For example, `desiredCount` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.
            - The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement. You can use this to define the replacement batch size. For example, if `desiredCount` is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.

            Any `PENDING` or `RUNNING` tasks that do not belong to a service aren't affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually.

            A container instance has completed draining when it has no more `RUNNING` tasks. You can verify this using [ListTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListTasks.html).

            When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to `ACTIVE` status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

When a task definition revision is not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.\n\nAmazon Elastic Inference (EI) is no longer available to customers.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see [Service load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n\nYou can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when creating or updating a service. `volumeConfigurations` is only supported for REPLICA service and not DAEMON service.

Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.\n\nThere are two service scheduler strategies available:\n\n- `REPLICA` - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n- `DAEMON` - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n\nThe deployment controller is the mechanism that determines how tasks are deployed for your service. The valid options are:\n\n- ECS\n  \n  When you create a service which uses the `ECS` deployment controller, you can choose between the following deployment strategies (which you can set in the “`strategy`” field in “`deploymentConfiguration`”): :\n  \n  - `ROLLING`: When you create a service which uses the *rolling update* (`ROLLING`) deployment strategy, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service deployment configuration. For more information, see [Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n    \n    Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:\n    \n    - Gradual service updates: You need to update your service incrementally without taking the entire service offline at once.\n    - Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the additional resource costs of running two complete environments simultaneously (as required by blue/green deployments).\n    - Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a longer deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one by one.\n    - No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a rollback process that takes minutes rather than seconds.\n    - Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple environments, target groups, and listeners.\n    - No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or require a load balancer, Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect (which are required for blue/green deployments).\n    - Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that makes it difficult to run two parallel environments.\n    - Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not running duplicate environments during deployment.\n    \n    Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for many common application scenarios.\n  - `BLUE_GREEN`: A *blue/green* deployment strategy (`BLUE_GREEN`) is a release methodology that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called blue and green. With Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you can validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the ability to quickly roll back if needed. For more information, see [Amazon ECS blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-blue-green.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n    \n    Amazon ECS blue/green deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:\n    \n    - Service validation: When you need to validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them\n    - Zero downtime: When your service requires zero-downtime deployments\n    - Instant roll back: When you need the ability to quickly roll back if issues are detected\n    - Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect\n  - `LINEAR`: A *linear* deployment strategy (`LINEAR`) gradually shifts traffic from the current production environment to a new environment in equal percentage increments. With Amazon ECS linear deployments, you can control the pace of traffic shifting and validate new service revisions with increasing amounts of production traffic.\n    \n    Linear deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:\n    \n    - Gradual validation: When you want to gradually validate your new service version with increasing traffic\n    - Performance monitoring: When you need time to monitor metrics and performance during the deployment\n    - Risk minimization: When you want to minimize risk by exposing the new version to production traffic incrementally\n    - Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application Load Balancer or Service Connect\n  - `CANARY`: A *canary* deployment strategy (`CANARY`) shifts a small percentage of traffic to the new service revision first, then shifts the remaining traffic all at once after a specified time period. This allows you to test the new version with a subset of users before full deployment.\n    \n    Canary deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:\n    \n    - Feature testing: When you want to test new features with a small subset of users before full rollout\n    - Production validation: When you need to validate performance and functionality with real production traffic\n    - Blast radius control: When you want to minimize blast radius if issues are discovered in the new version\n    - Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application Load Balancer or Service Connect\n- External\n  \n  Use a third-party deployment controller.\n- Blue/green deployment (powered by CodeDeploy)\n  \n  CodeDeploy installs an updated version of the application as a new replacement task set and reroutes production traffic from the original application task set to the replacement task set. The original task set is terminated after a successful deployment. Use this deployment controller to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it.\n\nWhen creating a service that uses the `EXTERNAL` deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the [CreateTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTaskSet.html). For more information, see [Amazon ECS deployment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n\nWhen the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement. For information about task placement and task placement strategies, see [Amazon ECS task placement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*"
        flag:
            availability-zone-rebalancing: |-
                Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.

                For more information, see [Balancing an Amazon ECS service across Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-rebalancing.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                The default behavior of `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` differs between create and update requests:

                - For create service requests, when no value is specified for `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults the value to `ENABLED`.
                - For update service requests, when no value is specified for `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults to the existing service’s `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value. If the service never had an `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value set, Amazon ECS treats this as `DISABLED`.
            capacity-provider-strategy: |-
                The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.

                If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType` request parameter.

                If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

                A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity providers.

            client-token: An identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 36 ASCII characters in the range of 33-126 (inclusive) are allowed.
            cluster: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that you run your service on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
            deployment-configuration: Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
            deployment-controller: The deployment controller to use for the service. If no deployment controller is specified, the default value of `ECS` is used.
            desired-count: |-
                The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running in your service.

                This is required if `schedulingStrategy` is `REPLICA` or isn't specified. If `schedulingStrategy` is `DAEMON` then this isn't required.
            enable-ecs-managed-tags: |-
                Specifies whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service. For more information, see [Tagging your Amazon ECS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                When you use Amazon ECS managed tags, you must set the `propagateTags` request parameter.
            enable-execute-command: Determines whether the execute command functionality is turned on for the service. If `true`, this enables execute command functionality on all containers in the service tasks.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            health-check-grace-period-seconds: |-
                The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container health checks after a task has first started. If you do not specify a health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used. If you do not use any of the health checks, then `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.

                If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in the grace period might be stopped to reach the desired count.
            launch-type: |-
                The infrastructure that you run your service on. For more information, see [Amazon ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType` request parameter.

                The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand infrastructure.

                Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider strategy must be used. For more information, see [Fargate capacity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.

                The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to your cluster.

                The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

                A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter must be omitted.
            load-balancers: |-
                A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your service. For more information, see [Service load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If the service uses the `ECS` deployment controller and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The service-linked role is required for services that use multiple target groups. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a `targetGroupPair`). During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status `PRIMARY`, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.

                If you use the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service.

                For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name, and the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container definition. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group that's specified here.

                For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name , and the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container definition. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer that's specified here.

                Services with tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren't supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose `ip` as the target type, not `instance`. This is because tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
            network-configuration: The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it isn't supported for other network modes. For more information, see [Task networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            placement-constraints: An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime.
            placement-strategy: The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.
            platform-version: The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A platform version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used. For more information, see [Fargate platform versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            propagate-tags: |-
                Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) API action.

                You must set this to a value other than `NONE` when you use Cost Explorer. For more information, see [Amazon ECS usage reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/usage-reports.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                The default is `NONE`.
            role: |-
                The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition doesn't use the `awsvpc` network mode. If you specify the `role` parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the `loadBalancers` parameter.

                If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't specify a role here. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/` then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see [Friendly names and paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names) in the *IAM User Guide*.
            scheduling-strategy: "The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see [Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).\n\nThere are two service scheduler strategies available:\n\n- `REPLICA`-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types.\n- `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.\n  \n  Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy."
            service-connect-configuration: |-
                The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.

                Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            service-name: The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.
            service-registries: |-
                The details of the service discovery registry to associate with this service. For more information, see [Service discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html).

                Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multiple service registries for each service isn't supported.
            tags: |-
                The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            task-definition: |-
                The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` isn't specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

                A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the `ECS` or `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controllers.

                For more information about deployment types, see [Amazon ECS deployment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html).
            volume-configurations: The configuration for a volume specified in the task definition as a volume that is configured at launch time. Currently, the only supported volume type is an Amazon EBS volume.

                The capacity provider strategy to use for the task set.

                A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the `base` and `weight` to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The [PutClusterCapacityProviders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutClusterCapacityProviders.html) API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an `ACTIVE` or `UPDATING` status can be used.

                If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

                If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProviderProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProviderProvider.html)API operation.

                To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the `FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.

                The launch type that new tasks in the task set uses. For more information, see [Amazon ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter must be omitted.
            load-balancers: A load balancer object representing the load balancer to use with the task set. The supported load balancer types are either an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer.
            network-configuration: An object representing the network configuration for a task set.
            platform-version: The platform version that the tasks in the task set uses. A platform version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used.
            scale: A floating-point percentage of the desired number of tasks to place and keep running in the task set.

            tags: |-
                The metadata that you apply to the task set to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            task-definition: The task definition for the tasks in the task set to use. If a revision isn't specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

            max-results: The maximum number of cluster results that `ListClusters` returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListClusters` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListClusters` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListClusters` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.

                The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListClusters` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls are needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it's possible the number of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

It can be expressed as an integer using CPU units (for example, `1024`) or as a string using vCPUs (for example, `1 vCPU` or `1 vcpu`) in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the CPU units when the task definition is registered.

                Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers.

                If you're using the EC2 launch type or external launch type, this field is optional. Supported values are between `128` CPU units (`0.125` vCPUs) and `196608` CPU units (`192` vCPUs). If you do not specify a value, the parameter is ignored.

                This field is required for Fargate. For information about the valid values, see [Task size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            enable-fault-injection: Enables fault injection when you register your task definition and allows for fault injection requests to be accepted from the task's containers. The default value is `false`.
            ephemeral-storage: |-
                The amount of ephemeral storage to allocate for the task. This parameter is used to expand the total amount of ephemeral storage available, beyond the default amount, for tasks hosted on Fargate. For more information, see [Using data volumes in tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.

                For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task requires the following platforms:

                - Linux platform version `1.4.0` or later.
                - Windows platform version `1.0.0` or later.
            execution-role-arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make Amazon Web Services API calls on your behalf.

            ipc-mode: |-
                The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are `host`, `task`, or `none`. If `host` is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the `host` IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If `task` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same IPC resources. If `none` is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance.

                If the `host` IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose.

                If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using `systemControls` for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see [System Controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                - For tasks that use the `host` IPC mode, IPC namespace related `systemControls` are not supported.
                - For tasks that use the `task` IPC mode, IPC namespace related `systemControls` will apply to all containers within a task.

                This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks run on Fargate.
            memory: "The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using MiB (for example ,`1024`) or as a string using GB (for example, `1GB` or `1 GB`) in a task definition.

            network-mode: |-
                The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are `none`, `bridge`, `awsvpc`, and `host`. If no network mode is specified, the default is `bridge`.

                For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the `awsvpc` network mode is required. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, `<default>` or `awsvpc` can be used. If the network mode is set to `none`, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The `host` and `awsvpc` network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the `bridge` mode.

                With the `host` and `awsvpc` network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the `host` network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the `awsvpc` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.

                When using the `host` network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.

                If the network mode is `awsvpc`, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a [NetworkConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_NetworkConfiguration.html) value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see [Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If the network mode is `host`, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used.
            pid-mode: |-
                The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are `host` or `task`. On Fargate for Linux containers, the only valid value is `task`. For example, monitoring sidecars might need `pidMode` to access information about other containers running in the same task.

                If `host` is specified, all containers within the tasks that specified the `host` PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace with the host Amazon EC2 instance.

                If `task` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same process namespace.

                If no value is specified, the The default is a private namespace for each container.

                If the `host` PID mode is used, there's a heightened risk of undesired process namespace exposure.

                This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.

                This parameter is only supported for tasks that are hosted on Fargate if the tasks are using platform version `1.4.0` or later (Linux). This isn't supported for Windows containers on Fargate.
            placement-constraints: An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime.
            proxy-configuration: |-
                The configuration details for the App Mesh proxy.

                For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the container instances require at least version `1.26.0` of the container agent and at least version `1.26.0-1` of the `ecs-init` package to use a proxy configuration. If your container instances are launched from the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI version `20190301` or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and `ecs-init`. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized AMI versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-ami-versions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            requires-compatibilities: The task launch type that Amazon ECS validates the task definition against. A client exception is returned if the task definition doesn't validate against the compatibilities specified. If no value is specified, the parameter is omitted from the response.
            runtime-platform: The operating system that your tasks definitions run on.
            tags: |-
                The metadata that you apply to the task definition to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both of them.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            task-role-arn: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that containers in this task can assume. All containers in this task are granted the permissions that are specified in this role. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            Updates the Amazon ECS container agent on a specified container instance. Updating the Amazon ECS container agent doesn't interrupt running tasks or services on the container instance. The process for updating the agent differs depending on whether your container instance was launched with the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or another operating system.

            The `UpdateContainerAgent` API isn't supported for container instances using the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 (arm64) AMI. To update the container agent, you can update the `ecs-init` package. This updates the agent. For more information, see [Updating the Amazon ECS container agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/agent-update-ecs-ami.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            Agent updates with the `UpdateContainerAgent` API operation do not apply to Windows container instances. We recommend that you launch new container instances to update the agent version in your Windows clusters.

            The `UpdateContainerAgent` API requires an Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or Amazon Linux AMI with the `ecs-init` service installed and running. For help updating the Amazon ECS container agent on other operating systems, see [Manually updating the Amazon ECS container agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html#manually_update_agent) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            You must deregister a task definition revision before you delete it. For more information, see [DeregisterTaskDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterTaskDefinition.html).

            When you delete a task definition revision, it is immediately transitions from the `INACTIVE` to `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`. Existing tasks and services that reference a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count.

            You can't use a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision to run new tasks or create new services. You also can't update an existing service to reference a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision.

            A task definition revision will stay in `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` status until all the associated tasks and services have been terminated.

            When you delete all `INACTIVE` task definition revisions, the task definition name is not displayed in the console and not returned in the API. If a task definition revisions are in the `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` state, the task definition name is displayed in the console and returned in the API. The task definition name is retained by Amazon ECS and the revision is incremented the next time you create a task definition with that name.

            Modifies the available capacity providers and the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster.

            You must specify both the available capacity providers and a default capacity provider strategy for the cluster. If the specified cluster has existing capacity providers associated with it, you must specify all existing capacity providers in addition to any new ones you want to add. Any existing capacity providers that are associated with a cluster that are omitted from a [PutClusterCapacityProviders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutClusterCapacityProviders.html) API call will be disassociated with the cluster. You can only disassociate an existing capacity provider from a cluster if it's not being used by any existing tasks.

            When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified, then the cluster's default capacity provider strategy is used. We recommend that you define a default capacity provider strategy for your cluster. However, you must specify an empty array (`[]`) to bypass defining a default strategy.

            Amazon ECS Managed Instances doesn't support this, because when you create a capacity provider with Amazon ECS Managed Instances, it becomes available only within the specified cluster.

New capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProvider.html) API operation.

                To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the `FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.

                When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified then the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster is used.

                A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the `base` and `weight` to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The [PutClusterCapacityProviders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutClusterCapacityProviders.html) API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an `ACTIVE` or `UPDATING` status can be used.

                If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProvider.html) API operation.

For more information, see [Migrate an Amazon ECS short service ARN to a long ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-arn-migration.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                `arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/service-name`

                `arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/cluster-name/service-name`

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

            Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a `default` cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name.

            When you call the [CreateCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCluster.html) API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account. This is so that it can manage required resources in other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. However, if the user that makes the call doesn't have permissions to create the service-linked role, it isn't created. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must be created but not associated with another cluster. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProvider.html) API operation.

                To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the `FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.

                The [PutCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutCapacityProvider.html) API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.

                Use this parameter to set a default Service Connect namespace.

This setting only applies to new services that set the `enabled` parameter to `true` in the `ServiceConnectConfiguration`. You can set the namespace of each service individually in the `ServiceConnectConfiguration` to override this default parameter.

                Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of task definition results that `ListTaskDefinitions` returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListTaskDefinitions` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListTaskDefinitions` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListTaskDefinitions` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListTaskDefinitions` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            sort: The order to sort the results in. Valid values are `ASC` and `DESC`. By default, (`ASC`) task definitions are listed lexicographically by family name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed last. Setting this parameter to `DESC` reverses the sort order on family name and revision. This is so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed first.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            status: The task definition status to filter the `ListTaskDefinitions` results with. By default, only `ACTIVE` task definitions are listed. By setting this parameter to `INACTIVE`, you can view task definitions that are `INACTIVE` as long as an active task or service still references them. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the `status` value constant in each subsequent request.

            name: "The Amazon ECS account setting name to modify.\n\nThe following are the valid values for the account setting name.\n\n- `serviceLongArnFormat` - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.\n- `taskLongArnFormat` - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.\n- `containerInstanceLongArnFormat` - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.\n- `awsvpcTrunking` - When modified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If `awsvpcTrunking` is turned on, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see [Elastic Network Interface Trunking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n- `containerInsights` - Container Insights with enhanced observability provides all the Container Insights metrics, plus additional task and container metrics. This version supports enhanced observability for Amazon ECS clusters using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch types. After you configure Container Insights with enhanced observability on Amazon ECS, Container Insights auto-collects detailed infrastructure telemetry from the cluster level down to the container level in your environment and displays these critical performance data in curated dashboards removing the heavy lifting in observability set-up.\n  \n  To use Container Insights with enhanced observability, set the `containerInsights` account setting to `enhanced`.\n  \n  To use Container Insights, set the `containerInsights` account setting to `enabled`.\n  \n  For more information, see [Monitor Amazon ECS containers using Container Insights with enhanced observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n- `dualStackIPv6` - When turned on, when using a VPC in dual stack mode, your tasks using the `awsvpc` network mode can have an IPv6 address assigned. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Amazon EC2 instances, see [Using a VPC in dual-stack mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html#task-networking-vpc-dual-stack). For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Fargate, see [Using a VPC in dual-stack mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-task-networking.html#fargate-task-networking-vpc-dual-stack).\n- `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` - When Amazon Web Services determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them. Use `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` to configure the wait time to retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance, see [Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.\n- `tagResourceAuthorization` - Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as `ecsCreateCluster`. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the `ecs:TagResource` action. For more information, see [Grant permission to tag resources on creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.\n- `defaultLogDriverMode` - Amazon ECS supports setting a default delivery mode of log messages from a container to the `logDriver` that you specify in the container's `logConfiguration`. The delivery mode affects application stability when the flow of logs from the container to the log driver is interrupted. The `defaultLogDriverMode` setting supports two values: `blocking` and `non-blocking`. If you don't specify a delivery mode in your container definition's `logConfiguration`, the mode you specify using this account setting will be used as the default. For more information about log delivery modes, see [LogConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.html).\n  \n  On June 25, 2025, Amazon ECS changed the default log driver mode from `blocking` to `non-blocking` to prioritize task availability over logging. To continue using the `blocking` mode after this change, do one of the following:\n  \n  - Set the `mode` option in your container definition's `logConfiguration` as `blocking`.\n  - Set the `defaultLogDriverMode` account setting to `blocking`.\n- `guardDutyActivate` - The `guardDutyActivate` parameter is read-only in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring is enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Amazon ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on your behalf. For more information, see [Protecting Amazon ECS workloads with Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-guard-duty-integration.html)."

If this field is omitted, the setting is changed only for the authenticated user.

                In order to use this parameter, you must be the root user, or the principal.

                You must use the root user when you set the Fargate wait time (`fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod`).

            Starts a new task using the specified task definition.

            On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.

            Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is no longer available to customers.

            You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information, see [Scheduling Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            Alternatively, you can use `StartTask` to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances.

            You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when creating or updating a service. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html#ebs-volume-types) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is because of the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command.

            To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:

            - Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.
            - Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

            If you get a `ConflictException` error, the `RunTask` request could not be processed due to conflicts. The provided `clientToken` is already in use with a different `RunTask` request. The `resourceIds` are the existing task ARNs which are already associated with the `clientToken`.

            To fix this issue:

            - Run `RunTask` with a unique `clientToken`.
            - Run `RunTask` with the `clientToken` and the original set of parameters

            If you get a `ClientException`error, the `RunTask` could not be processed because you use managed scaling and there is a capacity error because the quota of tasks in the `PROVISIONING` per cluster has been reached. For information about the service quotas, see [Amazon ECS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-quotas.html).
        flag:
            capacity-provider-strategy: |-
                The capacity provider strategy to use for the task.

                If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType` request parameter.

                If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

                When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify `capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.

                A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity providers.

            client-token: An identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 64 characters are allowed. The valid characters are characters in the range of 33-126, inclusive. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/ECS_Idempotency.html).
            cluster: |-
                The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to run your task on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

                Each account receives a default cluster the first time you use the service, but you may also create other clusters.
            count: The number of instantiations of the specified task to place on your cluster. You can specify up to 10 tasks for each call.
            enable-ecs-managed-tags: Specifies whether to use Amazon ECS managed tags for the task. For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            enable-execute-command: |-
                Determines whether to use the execute command functionality for the containers in this task. If `true`, this enables execute command functionality on all containers in the task.

                If `true`, then the task definition must have a task role, or you must provide one as an override.
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            group: The name of the task group to associate with the task. The default value is the family name of the task definition (for example, `family:my-family-name`).
            launch-type: |-
                The infrastructure to run your standalone task on. For more information, see [Amazon ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

                If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType` request parameter.

                The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand infrastructure.

                Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider strategy must be used. For more information, see [Fargate capacity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.

                The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to your cluster.

                The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

                A task can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter must be omitted.

                When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify `capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.
            network-configuration: The network configuration for the task. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it isn't supported for other network modes. For more information, see [Task networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            overrides: |-
                A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a container in the specified task definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the default command for a container (that's specified in the task definition or Docker image) with a `command` override. You can also override existing environment variables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or add new environment variables to it with an `environment` override.

                A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure.
            placement-constraints: An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify up to 10 constraints for each task (including constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).
            placement-strategy: The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each task.
            platform-version: The platform version the task uses. A platform version is only specified for tasks hosted on Fargate. If one isn't specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used. For more information, see [Fargate platform versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
            propagate-tags: |-
                Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the[TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) API action.

                An error will be received if you specify the `SERVICE` option when running a task.
            reference-id: This parameter is only used by Amazon ECS. It is not intended for use by customers.
            started-by: |-
                An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the `startedBy` parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a [ListTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListTasks.html) call with the `startedBy` value. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), forward slash (/), and underscores (\_) are allowed.

                If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the `startedBy` parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.
            tags: |-
                The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            task-definition: |-
                The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to run. If a `revision` isn't specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

                The full ARN value must match the value that you specified as the `Resource` of the principal's permissions policy.

                When you specify a task definition, you must either specify a specific revision, or all revisions in the ARN.

                To specify a specific revision, include the revision number in the ARN. For example, to specify revision 2, use `arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:2`.

                To specify all revisions, use the wildcard (\*) in the ARN. For example, to specify all revisions, use `arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:*`.

                For more information, see [Policy Resources for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
            volume-configurations: The details of the volume that was `configuredAtLaunch`. You can configure the size, volumeType, IOPS, throughput, snapshot and encryption in [TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration.html). The `name` of the volume must match the `name` from the task definition.

            Stops a running task. Any tags associated with the task will be deleted.

            When you call `StopTask` on a task, the equivalent of `docker stop` is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a `SIGTERM` value and a default 30-second timeout, after which the `SIGKILL` value is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the `SIGTERM` value gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no `SIGKILL` value is sent.

            For Windows containers, POSIX signals do not work and runtime stops the container by sending a `CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT`. For more information, see [Unable to react to graceful shutdown of (Windows) container #25982](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25982) on GitHub.

            The default 30-second timeout can be configured on the Amazon ECS container agent with the `ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT` variable.

            max-results: The maximum number of service results that `ListServices` returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListServices` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListServices` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListServices` returns up to 10 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListServices` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-management-type: The resourceManagementType type to use when filtering the `ListServices` results.
            scheduling-strategy: The scheduling strategy to use when filtering the `ListServices` results.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            started-by: |-
                An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the `startedBy` parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a [ListTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListTasks.html) call with the `startedBy` value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), forward slash (/), and underscores (\_) are allowed.

                If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, the `startedBy` parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.
            tags: |-
                The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            task-definition: The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to start. If a `revision` isn't specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.
            volume-configurations: The details of the volume that was `configuredAtLaunch`. You can configure the size, volumeType, IOPS, throughput, snapshot and encryption in [TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration.html). The `name` of the volume must match the `name` from the task definition.

            Deregisters the specified task definition by family and revision. Upon deregistration, the task definition is marked as `INACTIVE`. Existing tasks and services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count. If you want to delete a task definition revision, you must first deregister the task definition revision.

            You can't use an `INACTIVE` task definition to run new tasks or create new services, and you can't update an existing service to reference an `INACTIVE` task definition. However, there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect.

            At this time, `INACTIVE` task definitions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future. We don't recommend that you rely on `INACTIVE` task definitions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.

            You must deregister a task definition revision before you delete it. For more information, see [DeleteTaskDefinitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTaskDefinitions.html).

For more information, see [Elastic Network Interface Trunking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n- `containerInsights` - Container Insights with enhanced observability provides all the Container Insights metrics, plus additional task and container metrics. This version supports enhanced observability for Amazon ECS clusters using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch types. After you configure Container Insights with enhanced observability on Amazon ECS, Container Insights auto-collects detailed infrastructure telemetry from the cluster level down to the container level in your environment and displays these critical performance data in curated dashboards removing the heavy lifting in observability set-up.\n  \n  To use Container Insights with enhanced observability, set the `containerInsights` account setting to `enhanced`.\n  \n  To use Container Insights, set the `containerInsights` account setting to `enabled`.\n  \n  For more information, see [Monitor Amazon ECS containers using Container Insights with enhanced observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.\n- `dualStackIPv6` - When turned on, when using a VPC in dual stack mode, your tasks using the `awsvpc` network mode can have an IPv6 address assigned. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Amazon EC2 instances, see [Using a VPC in dual-stack mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html#task-networking-vpc-dual-stack).

For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance, see [Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.\n- `tagResourceAuthorization` - Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as `ecsCreateCluster`. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the `ecs:TagResource` action. For more information, see [Grant permission to tag resources on creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.\n- `defaultLogDriverMode` -Amazon ECS supports setting a default delivery mode of log messages from a container to the `logDriver` that you specify in the container's `logConfiguration`. The delivery mode affects application stability when the flow of logs from the container to the log driver is interrupted. The `defaultLogDriverMode` setting supports two values: `blocking` and `non-blocking`. If you don't specify a delivery mode in your container definition's `logConfiguration`, the mode you specify using this account setting will be used as the default. For more information about log delivery modes, see [LogConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.html).\n  \n  On June 25, 2025, Amazon ECS changed the default log driver mode from `blocking` to `non-blocking` to prioritize task availability over logging.

            cluster: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
            container-instance: The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results. Specifying a `containerInstance` limits the results to tasks that belong to that container instance.
            desired-status: |-
                The task desired status to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results. Specifying a `desiredStatus` of `STOPPED` limits the results to tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to `STOPPED`. This can be useful for debugging tasks that aren't starting properly or have died or finished. The default status filter is `RUNNING`, which shows tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to `RUNNING`.

                Although you can filter results based on a desired status of `PENDING`, this doesn't return any results. Amazon ECS never sets the desired status of a task to that value (only a task's `lastStatus` may have a value of `PENDING`).
            family: The name of the task definition family to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results. Specifying a `family` limits the results to tasks that belong to that family.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of task results that `ListTasks` returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListTasks` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListTasks` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `ListTasks` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListTasks` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it's possible the number of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            service-name: The name of the service to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results. Specifying a `serviceName` limits the results to tasks that belong to that service.
            started-by: |-
                The `startedBy` value to filter the task results with. Specifying a `startedBy` value limits the results to tasks that were started with that value.

                When you specify `startedBy` as the filter, it must be the only filter that you use.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use.
