        command: |-
            Creates a new tag-sync task to onboard and sync resources tagged with a specific tag key-value pair to an application. To start a tag-sync task, you need a [resource tagging role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/arguide/app-tag-sync.html#tag-sync-role). The resource tagging role grants permissions to tag and untag applications resources and must include a trust policy that allows Resource Groups to assume the role and perform resource tagging tasks on your behalf.

            For instructions on creating a tag-sync task, see [Create a tag-sync using the Resource Groups API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/arguide/app-tag-sync.html#create-tag-sync) in the *Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry Administrator Guide*.

            **Minimum permissions**

            To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

            - `resource-groups:StartTagSyncTask` on the application group
            - `resource-groups:CreateGroup`
            - `iam:PassRole` on the role provided in the request

            group: The Amazon resource name (ARN) or name of the application group for which you want to create a tag-sync task.
            resource-query: |-
                The query you can use to create the tag-sync task. With this method, all resources matching the query are added to the specified application group. A `ResourceQuery` specifies both a query `Type` and a `Query` string as JSON string objects. For more information on defining a resource query for a tag-sync task, see the tag-based query type in [Types of resource group queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html#getting_started-query_types) in *Resource Groups User Guide*.

                When using the `ResourceQuery` parameter, you cannot use the `TagKey` and `TagValue` parameters.

                When you combine all of the elements together into a single string, any double quotes that are embedded inside another double quote pair must be escaped by preceding the embedded double quote with a backslash character (\\). For example, a complete `ResourceQuery` parameter must be formatted like the following CLI parameter example:

                `--resource-query '{"Type":"TAG_FILTERS_1_0","Query":"{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Test\"]}]}"}'`

                In the preceding example, all of the double quote characters in the value part of the `Query` element must be escaped because the value itself is surrounded by double quotes. For more information, see [Quoting strings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html) in the *Command Line Interface User Guide*.

                For the complete list of resource types that you can use in the array value for `ResourceTypeFilters`, see [Resources you can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/supported-resources.html) in the *Resource Groups User Guide*. For example:

                `"ResourceTypeFilters":["AWS::S3::Bucket", "AWS::EC2::Instance"]`
            role-arn: The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the role assumed by the service to tag and untag resources on your behalf.
            tag-key: |-
                The tag key. Resources tagged with this tag key-value pair will be added to the application. If a resource with this tag is later untagged, the tag-sync task removes the resource from the application.

                When using the `TagKey` parameter, you must also specify the `TagValue` parameter. If you specify a tag key-value pair, you can't use the `ResourceQuery` parameter.
            tag-value: |-
                The tag value. Resources tagged with this tag key-value pair will be added to the application. If a resource with this tag is later untagged, the tag-sync task removes the resource from the application.

                When using the `TagValue` parameter, you must also specify the `TagKey` parameter. If you specify a tag key-value pair, you can't use the `ResourceQuery` parameter.

                A configuration associates the resource group with an Amazon Web Services service and specifies how the service can interact with the resources in the group. A configuration is an array of [GroupConfigurationItem]() elements. For details about the syntax of service configurations, see [Service configurations for Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html).

                A resource group can contain either a `Configuration` or a `ResourceQuery`, but not both.

                Filters, formatted as [ResourceFilter]() objects, that you want to apply to a `ListGroupResources` operation. Filters the results to include only those of the specified resource types.

                - `resource-type` - Filter resources by their type. Specify up to five resource types in the format `AWS::ServiceCode::ResourceType`. For example, `AWS::EC2::Instance`, or `AWS::S3::Bucket`.

                When you specify a `resource-type` filter for `ListGroupResources`, Resource Groups validates your filter resource types against the types that are defined in the query associated with the group. For example, if a group contains only S3 buckets because its query specifies only that resource type, but your `resource-type` filter includes EC2 instances, AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2 instances. In this case, a `ListGroupResources` request returns a `BadRequestException` error with a message similar to the following:

                `The resource types specified as filters in the request are not valid.`

                The error includes a list of resource types that failed the validation because they are not part of the query associated with the group. This validation doesn't occur when the group query specifies `AWS::AllSupported`, because a group based on such a query can contain any of the allowed resource types for the query type (tag-based or Amazon CloudFront stack-based queries).

Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by a previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from.

                The new configuration to associate with the specified group. A configuration associates the resource group with an Amazon Web Services service and specifies how the service can interact with the resources in the group. A configuration is an array of [GroupConfigurationItem]() elements.

                For information about the syntax of a service configuration, see [Service configurations for Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html).

                A resource group can contain either a `Configuration` or a `ResourceQuery`, but not both.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
            next-token: The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by a previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            resource-query: The search query, using the same formats that are supported for resource group definition. For more information, see [CreateGroup]().
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
