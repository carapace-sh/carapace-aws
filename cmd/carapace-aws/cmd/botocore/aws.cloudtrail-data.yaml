        command: Ingests your application events into CloudTrail Lake. A required parameter, `auditEvents`, accepts the JSON records (also called *payload*) of events that you want CloudTrail to ingest. You can add up to 100 of these events (or up to 1 MB) per `PutAuditEvents` request.
        flag:
            audit-events: The JSON payload of events that you want to ingest. You can also point to the JSON event payload in a file.

            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
