            Amazon S3 Vectors is in preview release for Amazon S3 and is subject to change.

            Performs an approximate nearest neighbor search query in a vector index using a query vector. By default, it returns the keys of approximate nearest neighbors. You can optionally include the computed distance (between the query vector and each vector in the response), the vector data, and metadata of each vector in the response.

            To specify the vector index, you can either use both the vector bucket name and the vector index name, or use the vector index Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

            Permissions

            You must have the `s3vectors:QueryVectors` permission to use this operation. Additional permissions are required based on the request parameters you specify:

            - With only `s3vectors:QueryVectors` permission, you can retrieve vector keys of approximate nearest neighbors and computed distances between these vectors. This permission is sufficient only when you don't set any metadata filters and don't request vector data or metadata (by keeping the `returnMetadata` parameter set to `false` or not specified).
            - If you specify a metadata filter or set `returnMetadata` to true, you must have both `s3vectors:QueryVectors` and `s3vectors:GetVectors` permissions. The request fails with a `403 Forbidden error` if you request metadata filtering, vector data, or metadata without the `s3vectors:GetVectors` permission.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: |-
                The maximum number of vectors to return on a page.

                If you don't specify `maxResults`, the `ListVectors` operation uses a default value of 500.

                If the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before reaching the `maxResults` value, the operation stops and returns the vectors that are retrieved up to that point, along with a `nextToken` that you can use in a subsequent request to retrieve the next set of results.
            next-token: Pagination token from a previous request. The value of this field is empty for an initial request.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            return-data: If true, the vector data of each vector will be included in the response. The default value is `false`.
            return-metadata: If true, the metadata associated with each vector will be included in the response. The default value is `false`.
            segment-count: |-
                For a parallel `ListVectors` request, `segmentCount` represents the total number of vector segments into which the `ListVectors` operation will be divided. The value of `segmentCount` corresponds to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel `ListVectors` operation. For example, if you want to use four application threads to list vectors in a vector index, specify a `segmentCount` value of 4.

                If you specify a `segmentCount` value of 1, the `ListVectors` operation will be sequential rather than parallel.

                If you specify `segmentCount`, you must also specify `segmentIndex`.
            segment-index: |-
                For a parallel `ListVectors` request, `segmentIndex` is the index of the segment from which to list vectors in the current request. It identifies an individual segment to be listed by an application worker.

                Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For example, if you want to use four application threads to list vectors in a vector index, then the first thread specifies a `segmentIndex` value of 0, the second thread specifies 1, and so on.

                The value of `segmentIndex` must be less than the value provided for `segmentCount`.

                If you provide `segmentIndex`, you must also provide `segmentCount`.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

            For more information about limits, see [Limitations and restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-vectors-limitations.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            When inserting vector data into your vector index, you must provide the vector data as `float32` (32-bit floating point) values. If you pass higher-precision values to an Amazon Web Services SDK, S3 Vectors converts the values to 32-bit floating point before storing them, and `GetVectors`, `ListVectors`, and `QueryVectors` operations return the float32 values. Different Amazon Web Services SDKs may have different default numeric types, so ensure your vectors are properly formatted as `float32` values regardless of which SDK you're using. For example, in Python, use `numpy.float32` or explicitly cast your values.

documentation:
    command: Amazon S3 vector buckets are a bucket type to store and search vectors with sub-second search times. They are designed to provide dedicated API operations for you to interact with vectors to do similarity search. Within a vector bucket, you use a vector index to organize and logically group your vector data. When you make a write or read request, you direct it to a single vector index. You store your vector data as vectors. A vector contains a key (a name that you assign), a multi-dimensional vector, and, optionally, metadata that describes a vector. The key uniquely identifies the vector in a vector index.
