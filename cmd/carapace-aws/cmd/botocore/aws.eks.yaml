        command: |-
            Creates a managed node group for an Amazon EKS cluster.

            You can only create a node group for your cluster that is equal to the current Kubernetes version for the cluster. All node groups are created with the latest AMI release version for the respective minor Kubernetes version of the cluster, unless you deploy a custom AMI using a launch template.

            For later updates, you will only be able to update a node group using a launch template only if it was originally deployed with a launch template. Additionally, the launch template ID or name must match what was used when the node group was created. You can update the launch template version with necessary changes. For more information about using launch templates, see [Customizing managed nodes with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html).

            An Amazon EKS managed node group is an Amazon EC2 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and associated Amazon EC2 instances that are managed by Amazon Web Services for an Amazon EKS cluster. For more information, see [Managed node groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

            Windows AMI types are only supported for commercial Amazon Web Services Regions that support Windows on Amazon EKS.
        flag:
            ami-type: The AMI type for your node group. If you specify `launchTemplate`, and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify `amiType`, or the node group deployment will fail. If your launch template uses a Windows custom AMI, then add `eks:kube-proxy-windows` to your Windows nodes `rolearn` in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap`. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see [Customizing managed nodes with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

            cluster-name: The name of your cluster.
            disk-size: The root device disk size (in GiB) for your node group instances. The default disk size is 20 GiB for Linux and Bottlerocket. The default disk size is 50 GiB for Windows. If you specify `launchTemplate`, then don't specify `diskSize`, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see [Customizing managed nodes with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            instance-types: Specify the instance types for a node group. If you specify a GPU instance type, make sure to also specify an applicable GPU AMI type with the `amiType` parameter. If you specify `launchTemplate`, then you can specify zero or one instance type in your launch template *or* you can specify 0-20 instance types for `instanceTypes`. If however, you specify an instance type in your launch template *and* specify any `instanceTypes`, the node group deployment will fail. If you don't specify an instance type in a launch template or for `instanceTypes`, then `t3.medium` is used, by default. If you specify `Spot` for `capacityType`, then we recommend specifying multiple values for `instanceTypes`. For more information, see [Managed node group capacity types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html#managed-node-group-capacity-types) and [Customizing managed nodes with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.
            kubernetes-version: The Kubernetes version to use for your managed nodes. By default, the Kubernetes version of the cluster is used, and this is the only accepted specified value. If you specify `launchTemplate`, and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify `version`, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see [Customizing managed nodes with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.
            labels: The Kubernetes `labels` to apply to the nodes in the node group when they are created.
            launch-template: |-
                An object representing a node group's launch template specification. When using this object, don't directly specify `instanceTypes`, `diskSize`, or `remoteAccess`. You cannot later specify a different launch template ID or name than what was used to create the node group.

                Make sure that the launch template meets the requirements in `launchTemplateSpecification`. Also refer to [Customizing managed nodes with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.
            node-repair-config: The node auto repair configuration for the node group.
            node-role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with your node group. The Amazon EKS worker node `kubelet` daemon makes calls to Amazon Web Services APIs on your behalf. Nodes receive permissions for these API calls through an IAM instance profile and associated policies. Before you can launch nodes and register them into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those nodes to use when they are launched. For more information, see [Amazon EKS node IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* . If you specify `launchTemplate`, then don't specify `IamInstanceProfile` in your launch template, or the node group deployment will fail.

            nodegroup-name: The unique name to give your node group.
            release-version: |-
                The AMI version of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI to use with your node group. By default, the latest available AMI version for the node group's current Kubernetes version is used. For information about Linux versions, see [Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux AMI versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-linux-ami-versions.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*. Amazon EKS managed node groups support the November 2022 and later releases of the Windows AMIs. For information about Windows versions, see [Amazon EKS optimized Windows AMI versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-ami-versions-windows.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                If you specify `launchTemplate`, and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify `releaseVersion`, or the node group deployment will fail.

            Creates an Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate.

            The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile's selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.

            When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (RBAC) for authorization so that the `kubelet` that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see [Pod Execution Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

            Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating.

            If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the `DELETING` status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster.

            For more information, see [Fargate profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                - **Overwrite** – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is different than the existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to the Amazon EKS default value.
                - **Preserve** – This is similar to the NONE option. If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster Amazon EKS doesn't change the add-on resource properties. Creation of the add-on might fail if conflicts are detected. This option works differently during the update operation. For more information, see [`UpdateAddon`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAddon.html) .

                If you don't currently have the self-managed version of the add-on installed on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed. Amazon EKS sets all values to default values, regardless of the option that you specify.

            If you want to authenticate identities using an identity provider, you can create an identity provider configuration and associate it to your cluster. After configuring authentication to your cluster you can create Kubernetes `Role` and `ClusterRole` objects, assign permissions to them, and then bind them to the identities using Kubernetes `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects.

            Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.

            The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as `etcd` and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.

            The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an ELB Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support `kubectl exec`, `logs`, and `proxy` data flows).

            Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.

            You can use the `endpointPublicAccess` and `endpointPrivateAccess` parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. The endpoint domain name and IP address family depends on the value of the `ipFamily` for the cluster. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

            You can use the `logging` parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

            CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see [CloudWatch Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

            In most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster. For more information, see [Allowing users to access your cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-auth.html) and [Launching Amazon EKS nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

            zonal-shift-config: |-
                Enable or disable ARC zonal shift for the cluster. If zonal shift is enabled, Amazon Web Services configures zonal autoshift for the cluster.

                Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC). ARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows you to move traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if necessary.

                You can start a zonal shift for an Amazon EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon Web Services to do it for you by enabling *zonal autoshift*. This shift updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy AZs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for applications in your Amazon EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to targets in the healthy AZs.

            Creates an access entry.

            An access entry allows an IAM principal to access your cluster. Access entries can replace the need to maintain entries in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` for authentication. You have the following options for authorizing an IAM principal to access Kubernetes objects on your cluster: Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC), Amazon EKS, or both. Kubernetes RBAC authorization requires you to create and manage Kubernetes `Role`, `ClusterRole`, `RoleBinding`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects, in addition to managing access entries. If you use Amazon EKS authorization exclusively, you don't need to create and manage Kubernetes `Role`, `ClusterRole`, `RoleBinding`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects.

            For more information about access entries, see [Access entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                Kubernetes authorizes the `principalArn` of the access entry to access any cluster objects that you've specified in a Kubernetes `Role` or `ClusterRole` object that is also specified in a binding's `roleRef`. For more information about creating Kubernetes `RoleBinding`, `ClusterRoleBinding`, `Role`, or `ClusterRole` objects, see [Using RBAC Authorization in the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

                If you want Amazon EKS to authorize the `principalArn` (instead of, or in addition to Kubernetes authorizing the `principalArn`), you can associate one or more access policies to the access entry using `AssociateAccessPolicy`. If you associate any access policies, the `principalARN` has all permissions assigned in the associated access policies and all permissions in any Kubernetes `Role` or `ClusterRole` objects that the group names are bound to.
            principal-arn: |-
                The ARN of the IAM principal for the `AccessEntry`. You can specify one ARN for each access entry. You can't specify the same ARN in more than one access entry. This value can't be changed after access entry creation.

                The valid principals differ depending on the type of the access entry in the `type` field. For `STANDARD` access entries, you can use every IAM principal type. For nodes (`EC2` (for EKS Auto Mode), `EC2_LINUX`, `EC2_WINDOWS`, `FARGATE_LINUX`, and `HYBRID_LINUX`), the only valid ARN is IAM roles. You can't use the STS session principal type with access entries because this is a temporary principal for each session and not a permanent identity that can be assigned permissions.

                [IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-users-federation-idp) recommend using IAM roles with temporary credentials, rather than IAM users with long-term credentials.
            tags: Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.
            type: |-
                The type of the new access entry. Valid values are `STANDARD`, `FARGATE_LINUX`, `EC2_LINUX`, `EC2_WINDOWS`, `EC2` (for EKS Auto Mode), `HYBRID_LINUX`, and `HYPERPOD_LINUX`.

                If the `principalArn` is for an IAM role that's used for self-managed Amazon EC2 nodes, specify `EC2_LINUX` or `EC2_WINDOWS`. Amazon EKS grants the necessary permissions to the node for you. If the `principalArn` is for any other purpose, specify `STANDARD`. If you don't specify a value, Amazon EKS sets the value to `STANDARD`. If you have the access mode of the cluster set to `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP`, it's unnecessary to create access entries for IAM roles used with Fargate profiles or managed Amazon EC2 nodes, because Amazon EKS creates entries in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` for the roles. You can't change this value once you've created the access entry.

                If you set the value to `EC2_LINUX` or `EC2_WINDOWS`, you can't specify values for `kubernetesGroups`, or associate an `AccessPolicy` to the access entry.
            username: The username to authenticate to Kubernetes with. We recommend not specifying a username and letting Amazon EKS specify it for you. For more information about the value Amazon EKS specifies for you, or constraints before specifying your own username, see [Creating access entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html#creating-access-entries) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

            Creates an EKS Pod Identity association between a service account in an Amazon EKS cluster and an IAM role with *EKS Pod Identity*. Use EKS Pod Identity to give temporary IAM credentials to Pods and the credentials are rotated automatically.

            Amazon EKS Pod Identity associations provide the ability to manage credentials for your applications, similar to the way that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to Amazon EC2 instances.

            If a Pod uses a service account that has an association, Amazon EKS sets environment variables in the containers of the Pod. The environment variables configure the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including the Command Line Interface, to use the EKS Pod Identity credentials.

            EKS Pod Identity is a simpler method than *IAM roles for service accounts*, as this method doesn't use OIDC identity providers. Additionally, you can configure a role for EKS Pod Identity once, and reuse it across clusters.

            Similar to Amazon Web Services IAM behavior, EKS Pod Identity associations are eventually consistent, and may take several seconds to be effective after the initial API call returns successfully. You must design your applications to account for these potential delays. We recommend that you don’t include association create/updates in the critical, high-availability code paths of your application. Instead, make changes in a separate initialization or setup routine that you run less frequently.

            You can set a *target IAM role* in the same or a different account for advanced scenarios. With a target role, EKS Pod Identity automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the role in the association that is in this account, then using those credentials to assume the target IAM role. This process provides your Pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in another Amazon Web Services account.

                Disable the automatic sessions tags that are appended by EKS Pod Identity.

                EKS Pod Identity adds a pre-defined set of session tags when it assumes the role. You can use these tags to author a single role that can work across resources by allowing access to Amazon Web Services resources based on matching tags. By default, EKS Pod Identity attaches six tags, including tags for cluster name, namespace, and service account name. For the list of tags added by EKS Pod Identity, see [List of session tags added by EKS Pod Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-abac.html#pod-id-abac-tags) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                Amazon Web Services compresses inline session policies, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. If you receive a `PackedPolicyTooLarge` error indicating the packed binary format has exceeded the size limit, you can attempt to reduce the size by disabling the session tags added by EKS Pod Identity.

                The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                - Maximum number of tags per resource – 50
                - For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
                - Maximum key length – 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - Maximum value length – 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
                - If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
                - Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
                - Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
            target-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target IAM role to associate with the service account. This role is assumed by using the EKS Pod Identity association role, then the credentials for this role are injected into the Pod.

                When you run applications on Amazon EKS, your application might need to access Amazon Web Services resources from a different role that exists in the same or different Amazon Web Services account. For example, your application running in “Account A” might need to access resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets in “Account B” or within “Account A” itself. You can create a association to access Amazon Web Services resources in “Account B” by creating two IAM roles: a role in “Account A” and a role in “Account B” (which can be the same or different account), each with the necessary trust and permission policies. After you provide these roles in the *IAM role* and *Target IAM role* fields, EKS will perform role chaining to ensure your application gets the required permissions. This means Role A will assume Role B, allowing your Pods to securely access resources like S3 buckets in the target account.

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of EKS Pod Identity association results returned by `ListPodIdentityAssociations` in paginated output. When you use this parameter, `ListPodIdentityAssociations` returns only `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another `ListPodIdentityAssociations` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, `ListPodIdentityAssociations` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.
            namespace: The name of the Kubernetes namespace inside the cluster that the associations are in.
            next-token: |-
                The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `ListUpdates` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value.

                This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            service-account: The name of the Kubernetes service account that the associations use.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC). ARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows you to move traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if necessary.

                You can start a zonal shift for an EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon Web Services to do it for you by enabling *zonal autoshift*. This shift updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy AZs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for applications in your EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to targets in the healthy AZs. For more information about zonal shift in EKS, see [Learn about Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Zonal Shift in Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/zone-shift.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

        command: |-
            Updates a EKS Pod Identity association. In an update, you can change the IAM role, the target IAM role, or `disableSessionTags`. You must change at least one of these in an update. An association can't be moved between clusters, namespaces, or service accounts. If you need to edit the namespace or service account, you need to delete the association and then create a new association with your desired settings.

            Similar to Amazon Web Services IAM behavior, EKS Pod Identity associations are eventually consistent, and may take several seconds to be effective after the initial API call returns successfully. You must design your applications to account for these potential delays. We recommend that you don’t include association create/updates in the critical, high-availability code paths of your application. Instead, make changes in a separate initialization or setup routine that you run less frequently.

            You can set a *target IAM role* in the same or a different account for advanced scenarios. With a target role, EKS Pod Identity automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the role in the association that is in this account, then using those credentials to assume the target IAM role. This process provides your Pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in another Amazon Web Services account.

                Disable the automatic sessions tags that are appended by EKS Pod Identity.

                EKS Pod Identity adds a pre-defined set of session tags when it assumes the role. You can use these tags to author a single role that can work across resources by allowing access to Amazon Web Services resources based on matching tags. By default, EKS Pod Identity attaches six tags, including tags for cluster name, namespace, and service account name. For the list of tags added by EKS Pod Identity, see [List of session tags added by EKS Pod Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-abac.html#pod-id-abac-tags) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                Amazon Web Services compresses inline session policies, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. If you receive a `PackedPolicyTooLarge` error indicating the packed binary format has exceeded the size limit, you can attempt to reduce the size by disabling the session tags added by EKS Pod Identity.

                When you run applications on Amazon EKS, your application might need to access Amazon Web Services resources from a different role that exists in the same or different Amazon Web Services account. For example, your application running in “Account A” might need to access resources, such as buckets in “Account B” or within “Account A” itself. You can create a association to access Amazon Web Services resources in “Account B” by creating two IAM roles: a role in “Account A” and a role in “Account B” (which can be the same or different account), each with the necessary trust and permission policies. After you provide these roles in the *IAM role* and *Target IAM role* fields, EKS will perform role chaining to ensure your application gets the required permissions. This means Role A will assume Role B, allowing your Pods to securely access resources like S3 buckets in the target account.

                For more information, see [Attach an IAM Role to an Amazon EKS add-on using EKS Pod Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-ons-iam.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.
            resolve-conflicts: |-
                How to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on if you've changed a value from the Amazon EKS default value. Conflicts are handled based on the option you choose:

                - **None** – Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. The update might fail.
                - **Overwrite** – Amazon EKS overwrites the changed value back to the Amazon EKS default value.
                - **Preserve** – Amazon EKS preserves the value. If you choose this option, we recommend that you test any field and value changes on a non-production cluster before updating the add-on on your production cluster.
            service-account-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to bind to the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM permissions required by the add-on. If you don't specify an existing IAM role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the node IAM role. For more information, see [Amazon EKS node IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

                To specify an existing IAM role, you must have an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider created for your cluster. For more information, see [Enabling IAM roles for service accounts on your cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Updates the Kubernetes version or AMI version of an Amazon EKS managed node group.

            You can update a node group using a launch template only if the node group was originally deployed with a launch template. Additionally, the launch template ID or name must match what was used when the node group was created. You can update the launch template version with necessary changes.

            If you need to update a custom AMI in a node group that was deployed with a launch template, then update your custom AMI, specify the new ID in a new version of the launch template, and then update the node group to the new version of the launch template.

            If you update without a launch template, then you can update to the latest available AMI version of a node group's current Kubernetes version by not specifying a Kubernetes version in the request. You can update to the latest AMI version of your cluster's current Kubernetes version by specifying your cluster's Kubernetes version in the request. For information about Linux versions, see [Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux AMI versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-linux-ami-versions.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*. For information about Windows versions, see [Amazon EKS optimized Windows AMI versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-ami-versions-windows.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

            You cannot roll back a node group to an earlier Kubernetes version or AMI version.

            When a node in a managed node group is terminated due to a scaling action or update, every `Pod` on that node is drained first. Amazon EKS attempts to drain the nodes gracefully and will fail if it is unable to do so. You can `force` the update if Amazon EKS is unable to drain the nodes as a result of a `Pod` disruption budget issue.

            Returns a list of all insights checked for against the specified cluster. You can filter which insights are returned by category, associated Kubernetes version, and status. The default filter lists all categories and every status.

            The following lists the available categories:

            - `UPGRADE_READINESS`: Amazon EKS identifies issues that could impact your ability to upgrade to new versions of Kubernetes. These are called upgrade insights.
            - `MISCONFIGURATION`: Amazon EKS identifies misconfiguration in your EKS Hybrid Nodes setup that could impair functionality of your cluster or workloads. These are called configuration insights.

            Cluster updates are asynchronous, and they should finish within a few minutes. During an update, the cluster status moves to `UPDATING` (this status transition is eventually consistent). When the update is complete (either `Failed` or `Successful`), the cluster status moves to `Active`.

            Second, a [Manifest](https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eks-connector/manifests/eks-connector/latest/eks-connector.yaml) containing the `activationID` and `activationCode` must be applied to the Kubernetes cluster through it's native provider to provide visibility.

            After the manifest is updated and applied, the connected cluster is visible to the Amazon EKS control plane. If the manifest isn't applied within three days, the connected cluster will no longer be visible and must be deregistered using `DeregisterCluster`.

        Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to setup or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

        Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.
