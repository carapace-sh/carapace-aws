            Creates a data export and specifies the data query, the delivery preference, and any optional resource tags.

            A `DataQuery` consists of both a `QueryStatement` and `TableConfigurations`.

            The `QueryStatement` is an SQL statement. Data Exports only supports a limited subset of the SQL syntax. For more information on the SQL syntax that is supported, see [Data query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/de-data-query.html). To view the available tables and columns, see the [Data Exports table dictionary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/de-table-dictionary.html).

            The `TableConfigurations` is a collection of specified `TableProperties` for the table being queried in the `QueryStatement`. TableProperties are additional configurations you can provide to change the data and schema of a table. Each table can have different TableProperties. However, tables are not required to have any TableProperties. Each table property has a default value that it assumes if not specified. For more information on table configurations, see [Data query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/de-data-query.html). To view the table properties available for each table, see the [Data Exports table dictionary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/de-table-dictionary.html) or use the `ListTables` API to get a response of all tables and their available properties.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
