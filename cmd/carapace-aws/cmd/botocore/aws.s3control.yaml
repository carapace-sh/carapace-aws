            This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle configuration. To delete an S3 bucket's lifecycle configuration, see [DeleteBucketLifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketLifecycle.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified Outposts bucket. Amazon S3 on Outposts removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 on Outposts no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3-outposts:PutLifecycleConfiguration` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and the Outposts bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`.

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateAccessPoint.html#API_control_CreateAccessPoint_Examples) section.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.

            This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket policy. To delete an S3 bucket policy, see [DeleteBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketPolicy.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the `s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this action. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            If you don't have `DeleteBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

            As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

            For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy.html#API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy_Examples) section.

            The following actions are related to `DeleteBucketPolicy`:

            - [GetBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketPolicy.html)
            - [PutBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketPolicy.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            account-id: The account ID of the Outposts bucket.
            bucket: |-
                Specifies the bucket.

                For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.

            This operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To delete an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [DeleteBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketReplication.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket.

            To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration` action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see [Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html) and [Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            It can take a while to propagate `PUT` or `DELETE` requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a `GET` request soon after a `PUT` or `DELETE` request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketReplication.html#API_control_DeleteBucketReplication_Examples) section.

            For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            - [GetBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketReplication.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

                For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`.

            Deletes the tags from the Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            To use this action, you must have permission to perform the `PutBucketTagging` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketTagging.html#API_control_DeleteBucketTagging_Examples) section.

To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see [Cost allocation and tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html).\n\nWithin a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value.

            This operation sets the versioning state for S3 on Outposts buckets only. To set the versioning state for an S3 bucket, see [PutBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Sets the versioning state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your objects and recover from unintended user actions and application failures.

            You can set the versioning state to one of the following:

            - **Enabled** - Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
            - **Suspended** - Suspends versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID `null`.

            If you've never set versioning on your bucket, it has no versioning state. In that case, a [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value.

            When you enable S3 Versioning, for each object in your bucket, you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. You can configure your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire noncurrent versions after a specified time period. For more information, see [Creating and managing a lifecycle configuration for your S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsLifecycleManaging.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            If you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. For more information, see [Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request.

            Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Outposts bucket, the calling identity must have the `PutBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this action.

            If you don't have `PutBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

            As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

            For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).

                For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`.

            This action creates an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To create an S3 bucket, see [Create Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Creates a new Outposts bucket. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. To create an Outposts bucket, you must have S3 on Outposts. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming restrictions, see [Working with Amazon S3 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules).

            S3 on Outposts buckets support:

            - Tags
            - LifecycleConfigurations for deleting expired objects

            For a complete list of restrictions and Amazon S3 feature limitations on S3 on Outposts, see [Amazon S3 on Outposts Restrictions and Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OnOutpostsRestrictionsLimitations.html).

            For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and `x-amz-outpost-id` in your API request, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html#API_control_CreateBucket_Examples) section.

            This operation gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To get an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [GetBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketReplication.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Returns the replication configuration of an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            It can take a while to propagate `PUT` or `DELETE` requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a `GET` request soon after a `PUT` or `DELETE` request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

            This action requires permissions for the `s3-outposts:GetReplicationConfiguration` action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see [Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html) and [Managing access to S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketReplication.html#API_control_GetBucketReplication_Examples) section.

            If you include the `Filter` element in a replication configuration, you must also include the `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and `Priority` elements. The response also returns those elements.

            For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see [Replication failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/outposts-replication-eventbridge.html#outposts-replication-failure-codes) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`.

            Use this API to list the access grants that grant the caller access to Amazon S3 data through S3 Access Grants. The caller (grantee) can be an Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity or Amazon Web Services Identity Center corporate directory identity. You must pass the Amazon Web Services account of the S3 data owner (grantor) in the request. You can, optionally, narrow the results by `GrantScope`, using a fragment of the data's S3 path, and S3 Access Grants will return only the grants with a path that contains the path fragment. You can also pass the `AllowedByApplication` filter in the request, which returns only the grants authorized for applications, whether the application is the caller's Identity Center application or any other application (`ALL`). For more information, see [List the caller's access grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants-list-grants.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        command: |-
            This action creates an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To create an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [PutBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketReplication.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

            Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            It can take a while to propagate `PUT` or `DELETE` requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a `GET` request soon after a `PUT` or `DELETE` request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

            Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the following information:

            - The name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want S3 on Outposts to replicate objects
            - The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that S3 on Outposts can assume to replicate objects on your behalf
            - Other relevant information, such as replication rules

            A replication configuration must include at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 100. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source Outposts bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

            To specify a subset of the objects in the source Outposts bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the `Filter` element as a child of the `Rule` element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the `Filter` element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and `Priority`.

            Using `PutBucketReplication` on Outposts requires that both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see [Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.html).

            For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see [Replication failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/outposts-replication-eventbridge.html#outposts-replication-failure-codes) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            **Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**

            Outposts buckets are encrypted at all times. All the objects in the source Outposts bucket are encrypted and can be replicated. Also, all the replicas in the destination Outposts bucket are encrypted with the same encryption key as the objects in the source Outposts bucket.

            **Permissions**

            To create a `PutBucketReplication` request, you must have `s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration` permissions for the bucket. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see [Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html) and [Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html).

            To perform this operation, the user or role must also have the `iam:CreateRole` and `iam:PassRole` permissions. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html).

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketReplication.html#API_control_PutBucketReplication_Examples) section.

            The following operations are related to `PutBucketReplication`:

                For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.

            Submits an updated route configuration for a Multi-Region Access Point. This API operation updates the routing status for the specified Regions from active to passive, or from passive to active. A value of `0` indicates a passive status, which means that traffic won't be routed to the specified Region. A value of `100` indicates an active status, which means that traffic will be routed to the specified Region. At least one Region must be active at all times.

            When the routing configuration is changed, any in-progress operations (uploads, copies, deletes, and so on) to formerly active Regions will continue to run to their final completion state (success or failure). The routing configurations of any Regions that aren’t specified remain unchanged.

            Updated routing configurations might not be immediately applied. It can take up to 2 minutes for your changes to take effect.

            To submit routing control changes and failover requests, use the Amazon S3 failover control infrastructure endpoints in these five Amazon Web Services Regions:

            - `us-east-1`
            - `us-west-2`
            - `ap-southeast-2`

            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the `GetBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this action.

            Only users from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions can perform actions on an Outposts bucket. If you don't have `s3-outposts:GetBucketPolicy` permissions or you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error.

            As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

            For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).

            All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketPolicy.html#API_control_GetBucketPolicy_Examples) section.

            The following actions are related to `GetBucketPolicy`:

            - [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)
            - [PutBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketPolicy.html)
            - [DeleteBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy.html)

            You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
        flag:
            account-id: The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.
            bucket: |-
                Specifies the bucket.

                For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

                For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.
