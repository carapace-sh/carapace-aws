            Generates an embedding URL for an Amazon QuickSight dashboard for an anonymous user.

            This API is available only to Amazon Web Services Organization management accounts or delegated administrators registered for the procurement insights (`procurement-insights.marketplace.amazonaws.com`) feature.

            The following rules apply to a generated URL:

            - It contains a temporary bearer token, valid for 5 minutes after it is generated. Once redeemed within that period, it cannot be re-used again.
            - It has a session lifetime of one hour. The 5-minute validity period runs separately from the session lifetime.
        flag:
            cli-input-json: |-
                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

For example, `https://*.amazon.com` includes all subdomains under `https://aws.amazon.com`.
