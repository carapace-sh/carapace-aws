            Marks a custom action as deleted. `PollForJobs` for the custom action fails after the action is marked for deletion. Used for custom actions only.

            To re-create a custom action after it has been deleted you must use a string in the version field that has never been used before. This string can be an incremented version number, for example. To restore a deleted custom action, use a JSON file that is identical to the deleted action, including the original string in the version field.

        command: |-
            Defines a webhook and returns a unique webhook URL generated by CodePipeline. This URL can be supplied to third party source hosting providers to call every time there's a code change. When CodePipeline receives a POST request on this URL, the pipeline defined in the webhook is started as long as the POST request satisfied the authentication and filtering requirements supplied when defining the webhook. RegisterWebhookWithThirdParty and DeregisterWebhookWithThirdParty APIs can be used to automatically configure supported third parties to call the generated webhook URL.

            When creating CodePipeline webhooks, do not use your own credentials or reuse the same secret token across multiple webhooks. For optimal security, generate a unique secret token for each webhook you create. The secret token is an arbitrary string that you provide, which GitHub uses to compute and sign the webhook payloads sent to CodePipeline, for protecting the integrity and authenticity of the webhook payloads. Using your own credentials or reusing the same token across multiple webhooks can lead to security vulnerabilities.

            If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in the response.
