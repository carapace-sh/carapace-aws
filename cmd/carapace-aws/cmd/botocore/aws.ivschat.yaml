            The `attributes` field securely attaches structured data to the chat session; the data is included within each message sent by the end user and received by other participants in the room. Common use cases for attributes include passing end-user profile data like an icon, display name, colors, badges, and other display features.

            Encryption keys are owned by Amazon IVS Chat and never used directly by your application.
