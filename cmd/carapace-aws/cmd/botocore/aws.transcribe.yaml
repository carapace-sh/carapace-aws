            Creates a new custom vocabulary.

            When creating a new custom vocabulary, you can either upload a text file that contains your new entries, phrases, and terms into an Amazon S3 bucket and include the URI in your request. Or you can include a list of terms directly in your request using the `Phrases` flag.

            Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.

            For more information, see [Custom vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-vocabulary.html).

                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            data-access-role-arn: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files (in this case, your custom vocabulary). If the role that you specify doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

                IAM role ARNs have the format `arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path`. For example: `arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin`.

                For more information, see [IAM ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns).

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            language-code: |-
                The language code that represents the language of the entries in your custom vocabulary. Each custom vocabulary must contain terms in only one language.

                A custom vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the custom vocabulary. For example, if you create a custom vocabulary using US English (`en-US`), you can only apply this custom vocabulary to files that contain English audio.

                For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) table.
            phrases: |-
                Use this parameter if you want to create your custom vocabulary by including all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your request. The other option for creating your custom vocabulary is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the `VocabularyFileUri` parameter.

                Note that if you include `Phrases` in your request, you cannot use `VocabularyFileUri`; you must choose one or the other.

                Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.
            tags: |-
                Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new custom vocabulary at the time you create this new custom vocabulary.

                To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Tagging resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html).
            vocabulary-file-uri: |-
                The Amazon S3 location of the text file that contains your custom vocabulary. The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the resource you're calling.

                Here's an example URI path: `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-file.txt`

                Note that if you include `VocabularyFileUri` in your request, you cannot use the `Phrases` flag; you must choose one or the other.
            vocabulary-name: |-
                A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary.

                This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new custom vocabulary with the same name as an existing custom vocabulary, you get a `ConflictException` error.

        command: |-
            Transcribes the audio from a medical dictation or conversation and applies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include in your request.

            In addition to many standard transcription features, Amazon Transcribe Medical provides you with a robust medical vocabulary and, optionally, content identification, which adds flags to personal health information (PHI). To learn more about these features, refer to [How Amazon Transcribe Medical works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-it-works-med.html).

            To make a `StartMedicalTranscriptionJob` request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the `Media` parameter.

            You must include the following parameters in your `StartMedicalTranscriptionJob` request:

            - `region`: The Amazon Web Services Region where you are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe.html).
            - `MedicalTranscriptionJobName`: A custom name you create for your transcription job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.
            - `Media` (`MediaFileUri`): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.
            - `LanguageCode`: This must be `en-US`.
            - `OutputBucketName`: The Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcript stored. If you want your output stored in a sub-folder of this bucket, you must also include `OutputKey`.
            - `Specialty`: This must be `PRIMARYCARE`.
            - `Type`: Choose whether your audio is a conversation or a dictation.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            content-identification-type: Labels all personal health information (PHI) identified in your transcript. For more information, see [Identifying personal health information (PHI) in a transcription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/phi-id.html).
            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            kms-encryption-context: A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption context pairs, that provide an added layer of security for your data. For more information, see [KMS encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/key-management.html#kms-context) and [Asymmetric keys in KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/symmetric-asymmetric.html).
            language-code: The language code that represents the language spoken in the input media file. US English (`en-US`) is the only valid value for medical transcription jobs. Any other value you enter for language code results in a `BadRequestException` error.
            media: ""
            media-format: Specify the format of your input media file.
            media-sample-rate-hertz: |-
                The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input media file.

                If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe Medical determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe Medical; if there's a mismatch between the value that you specify and the value detected, your job fails. Therefore, in most cases, it's advised to omit `MediaSampleRateHertz` and let Amazon Transcribe Medical determine the sample rate.
            medical-transcription-job-name: |-
                A unique name, chosen by you, for your medical transcription job. The name that you specify is also used as the default name of your transcription output file. If you want to specify a different name for your transcription output, use the `OutputKey` parameter.

                This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new job with the same name as an existing job, you get a `ConflictException` error.
            output-bucket-name: |-
                The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your medical transcription output stored. Do not include the `S3://` prefix of the specified bucket.

                If you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket, specify it using the `OutputKey` parameter; `OutputBucketName` only accepts the name of a bucket.

                For example, if you want your output stored in `S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`, set `OutputBucketName` to `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`. However, if you want your output stored in `S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/`, set `OutputBucketName` to `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET` and `OutputKey` to `test-files/`.

                Note that Amazon Transcribe must have permission to use the specified location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the [Amazon Web Services Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3). See also [Permissions Required for IAM User Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#auth-role-iam-user).
            output-encryption-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key that you want to use to encrypt your medical transcription output.

                KMS key ARNs have the format `arn:partition:kms:region:account:key/key-id`. For example: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`. For more information, see [KMS key ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-ARN).

                If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

                Note that the role making the request and the role specified in the `DataAccessRoleArn` request parameter (if present) must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
            output-key: |-
                Use in combination with `OutputBucketName` to specify the output location of your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your output file. The default name for your transcription output is the same as the name you specified for your medical transcription job (`MedicalTranscriptionJobName`).

                Here are some examples of how you can use `OutputKey`:

                - If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName` and 'my-transcript.json' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json`.
                - If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the `MedicalTranscriptionJobName`, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName`, and 'my-transcript' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json`.
                - If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName` and 'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript.json`.
                - If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the `MedicalTranscriptionJobName`, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName`, and 'test-files/my-transcript' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json`.

                If you specify the name of an Amazon S3 bucket sub-folder that doesn't exist, one is created for you.
            settings: Specify additional optional settings in your request, including channel identification, alternative transcriptions, and speaker partitioning. You can use that to apply custom vocabularies to your transcription job.
            specialty: Specify the predominant medical specialty represented in your media. For batch transcriptions, `PRIMARYCARE` is the only valid value. If you require additional specialties, refer to .
            tags: |-
                Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new medical transcription job at the time you start this new job.

                To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Tagging resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html).
            type: |-
                Specify whether your input media contains only one person (`DICTATION`) or contains a conversation between two people (`CONVERSATION`).

                For example, `DICTATION` could be used for a medical professional wanting to transcribe voice memos; `CONVERSATION` could be used for transcribing the doctor-patient dialogue during the patient's office visit.

                Here's an example URI path: `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-filter-file.txt`

                Note that if you include `VocabularyFilterFileUri` in your request, you cannot use `Words`; you must choose one or the other.
            vocabulary-filter-name: The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to update. Custom vocabulary filter names are case sensitive.
            words: |-
                Use this parameter if you want to update your custom vocabulary filter by including all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your request. The other option for updating your vocabulary filter is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the `VocabularyFilterFileUri` parameter.

            Transcribes the audio from a customer service call and applies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include in your request.

            In addition to many standard transcription features, Call Analytics provides you with call characteristics, call summarization, speaker sentiment, and optional redaction of your text transcript and your audio file. You can also apply custom categories to flag specified conditions. To learn more about these features and insights, refer to [Analyzing call center audio with Call Analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/call-analytics.html).

            If you want to apply categories to your Call Analytics job, you must create them before submitting your job request. Categories cannot be retroactively applied to a job. To create a new category, use the operation. To learn more about Call Analytics categories, see [Creating categories for post-call transcriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-batch.html) and [Creating categories for real-time transcriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-stream.html).

            To make a `StartCallAnalyticsJob` request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the `Media` parameter.

            Job queuing is available for Call Analytics jobs. If you pass a `DataAccessRoleArn` in your request and you exceed your Concurrent Job Limit, your job will automatically be added to a queue to be processed once your concurrent job count is below the limit.

            You must include the following parameters in your `StartCallAnalyticsJob` request:

            - `region`: The Amazon Web Services Region where you are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe.html).
            - `CallAnalyticsJobName`: A custom name that you create for your transcription job that's unique within your Amazon Web Services account.
            - `Media` (`MediaFileUri` or `RedactedMediaFileUri`): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.

            With Call Analytics, you can redact the audio contained in your media file by including `RedactedMediaFileUri`, instead of `MediaFileUri`, to specify the location of your input audio. If you choose to redact your audio, you can find your redacted media at the location specified in the `RedactedMediaFileUri` field of your response.
        flag:
            call-analytics-job-name: |-
                A unique name, chosen by you, for your Call Analytics job.

                This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new job with the same name as an existing job, you get a `ConflictException` error.
            channel-definitions: Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set `ChannelId` to `0` (to indicate the first channel) and `ParticipantRole` to `AGENT` (to indicate that it's the agent speaking).

                IAM role ARNs have the format `arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path`. For example: `arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin`.

            output-encryption-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key that you want to use to encrypt your Call Analytics output.

                KMS key ARNs have the format `arn:partition:kms:region:account:key/key-id`. For example: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`. For more information, see [KMS key ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-ARN).

                If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

                Note that the role making the request and the role specified in the `DataAccessRoleArn` request parameter (if present) must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
            output-location: |-
                The Amazon S3 location where you want your Call Analytics transcription output stored. You can use any of the following formats to specify the output location:

                1. s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET
                2. s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-output-folder/
                3. s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-output-folder/my-call-analytics-job.json

                Unless you specify a file name (option 3), the name of your output file has a default value that matches the name you specified for your transcription job using the `CallAnalyticsJobName` parameter.

                You can specify a KMS key to encrypt your output using the `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` parameter. If you do not specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption.

                If you do not specify `OutputLocation`, your transcript is placed in a service-managed Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a URI to access your transcript.
            settings: Specify additional optional settings in your request, including content redaction; allows you to apply custom language models, vocabulary filters, and custom vocabularies to your Call Analytics job.

            Creates a new custom medical vocabulary.

            Before creating a new custom medical vocabulary, you must first upload a text file that contains your vocabulary table into an Amazon S3 bucket. Note that this differs from , where you can include a list of terms within your request using the `Phrases` flag; `CreateMedicalVocabulary` does not support the `Phrases` flag and only accepts vocabularies in table format.

            Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.

            For more information, see [Custom vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-vocabulary.html).

            Transcribes patient-clinician conversations and generates clinical notes.

            Amazon Web Services HealthScribe automatically provides rich conversation transcripts, identifies speaker roles, classifies dialogues, extracts medical terms, and generates preliminary clinical notes. To learn more about these features, refer to [Amazon Web Services HealthScribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/health-scribe.html).

            To make a `StartMedicalScribeJob` request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the `Media` parameter.

            You must include the following parameters in your `StartMedicalTranscriptionJob` request:

            - `DataAccessRoleArn`: The ARN of an IAM role with the these minimum permissions: read permission on input file Amazon S3 bucket specified in `Media`, write permission on the Amazon S3 bucket specified in `OutputBucketName`, and full permissions on the KMS key specified in `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` (if set). The role should also allow `transcribe.amazonaws.com` to assume it.
            - `Media` (`MediaFileUri`): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.
            - `MedicalScribeJobName`: A custom name you create for your MedicalScribe job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.
            - `OutputBucketName`: The Amazon S3 bucket where you want your output files stored.
            - `Settings`: A `MedicalScribeSettings` object that must set exactly one of `ShowSpeakerLabels` or `ChannelIdentification` to true. If `ShowSpeakerLabels` is true, `MaxSpeakerLabels` must also be set.
            - `ChannelDefinitions`: A `MedicalScribeChannelDefinitions` array should be set if and only if the `ChannelIdentification` value of `Settings` is set to true.
        flag:
            channel-definitions: Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if the clinician is the first participant to speak, you would set `ChannelId` of the first `ChannelDefinition` in the list to `0` (to indicate the first channel) and `ParticipantRole` to `CLINICIAN` (to indicate that it's the clinician speaking). Then you would set the `ChannelId` of the second `ChannelDefinition` in the list to `1` (to indicate the second channel) and `ParticipantRole` to `PATIENT` (to indicate that it's the patient speaking).

            Creates a new custom vocabulary filter.

            You can use custom vocabulary filters to mask, delete, or flag specific words from your transcript. Custom vocabulary filters are commonly used to mask profanity in transcripts.

            Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.

            For more information, see [Vocabulary filtering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/vocabulary-filtering.html).

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files (in this case, your custom vocabulary filter). If the role that you specify doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

                IAM role ARNs have the format `arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path`. For example: `arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin`.

                For more information, see [IAM ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns).

                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            language-code: |-
                The language code that represents the language of the entries in your vocabulary filter. Each custom vocabulary filter must contain terms in only one language.

                A custom vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a custom vocabulary filter using US English (`en-US`), you can only apply this filter to files that contain English audio.

                For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) table.

                Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new custom vocabulary filter at the time you create this new vocabulary filter.

                To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Tagging resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html).

                The Amazon S3 location of the text file that contains your custom vocabulary filter terms. The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the resource you're calling.

                Here's an example URI path: `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-filter-file.txt`

                Note that if you include `VocabularyFilterFileUri` in your request, you cannot use `Words`; you must choose one or the other.
            vocabulary-filter-name: |-
                A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary filter.

                This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new custom vocabulary filter with the same name as an existing custom vocabulary filter, you get a `ConflictException` error.
            words: |-
                Use this parameter if you want to create your custom vocabulary filter by including all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your request. The other option for creating your vocabulary filter is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the `VocabularyFilterFileUri` parameter.

                Note that if you include `Words` in your request, you cannot use `VocabularyFilterFileUri`; you must choose one or the other.

                Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.

            Transcribes the audio from a media file and applies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include in your request.

            To make a `StartTranscriptionJob` request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the `Media` parameter.

            You must include the following parameters in your `StartTranscriptionJob` request:

            - `region`: The Amazon Web Services Region where you are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe.html).
            - `TranscriptionJobName`: A custom name you create for your transcription job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.
            - `Media` (`MediaFileUri`): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.
            - One of `LanguageCode`, `IdentifyLanguage`, or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages`: If you know the language of your media file, specify it using the `LanguageCode` parameter; you can find all valid language codes in the [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) table. If you do not know the languages spoken in your media, use either `IdentifyLanguage` or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` and let Amazon Transcribe identify the languages for you.

            identify-language: |-
                Enables automatic language identification in your transcription job request. Use this parameter if your media file contains only one language. If your media contains multiple languages, use `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` instead.

                If you include `IdentifyLanguage`, you can optionally include a list of language codes, using `LanguageOptions`, that you think may be present in your media file. Including `LanguageOptions` restricts `IdentifyLanguage` to only the language options that you specify, which can improve transcription accuracy.

                If you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter to your automatic language identification request, include `LanguageIdSettings` with the relevant sub-parameters (`VocabularyName`, `LanguageModelName`, and `VocabularyFilterName`). If you include `LanguageIdSettings`, also include `LanguageOptions`.

                Note that you must include one of `LanguageCode`, `IdentifyLanguage`, or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` in your request. If you include more than one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.
            identify-multiple-languages: |-
                Enables automatic multi-language identification in your transcription job request. Use this parameter if your media file contains more than one language. If your media contains only one language, use `IdentifyLanguage` instead.

                If you include `IdentifyMultipleLanguages`, you can optionally include a list of language codes, using `LanguageOptions`, that you think may be present in your media file. Including `LanguageOptions` restricts `IdentifyLanguage` to only the language options that you specify, which can improve transcription accuracy.

                If you want to apply a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter to your automatic language identification request, include `LanguageIdSettings` with the relevant sub-parameters (`VocabularyName` and `VocabularyFilterName`). If you include `LanguageIdSettings`, also include `LanguageOptions`.

                Note that you must include one of `LanguageCode`, `IdentifyLanguage`, or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` in your request. If you include more than one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.
            job-execution-settings: |-
                Makes it possible to control how your transcription job is processed. Currently, the only `JobExecutionSettings` modification you can choose is enabling job queueing using the `AllowDeferredExecution` sub-parameter.

                If you include `JobExecutionSettings` in your request, you must also include the sub-parameters: `AllowDeferredExecution` and `DataAccessRoleArn`.
            kms-encryption-context: A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption context pairs, that provide an added layer of security for your data. For more information, see [KMS encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/key-management.html#kms-context) and [Asymmetric keys in KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/symmetric-asymmetric.html).
            language-code: |-
                The language code that represents the language spoken in the input media file.

                If you're unsure of the language spoken in your media file, consider using `IdentifyLanguage` or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` to enable automatic language identification.

                Note that you must include one of `LanguageCode`, `IdentifyLanguage`, or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` in your request. If you include more than one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.

                For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) table.

                To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic (`ar-SA`) in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-West, us-gov-west-1), Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-East, us-gov-east-1), Canada (Calgary, ca-west-1) and Africa (Cape Town, af-south-1), your media file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.
            language-id-settings: |-
                If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include `LanguageIdSettings` with the relevant sub-parameters (`VocabularyName`, `LanguageModelName`, and `VocabularyFilterName`). Note that multi-language identification (`IdentifyMultipleLanguages`) doesn't support custom language models.

                `LanguageIdSettings` supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

                It's recommended that you include `LanguageOptions` when using `LanguageIdSettings` to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in `en-US` but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is `en-AU`, your custom vocabulary *is not* applied to your transcription. If you include `LanguageOptions` and include `en-US` as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary *is* applied to your transcription.

                If you want to include a custom language model with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the `parameter with the LanguageModelName sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but do not want to use automatic language identification, use instead the parameter with the VocabularyName or VocabularyFilterName (or both) sub-parameter.`
            language-options: |-
                You can specify two or more language codes that represent the languages you think may be present in your media. Including more than five is not recommended. If you're unsure what languages are present, do not include this parameter.

                If you include `LanguageOptions` in your request, you must also include `IdentifyLanguage`.

                For more information, refer to [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html).

                To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic (`ar-SA`)in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-West, us-gov-west-1), Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-East, us-gov-east-1), in Canada (Calgary) ca-west-1 and Africa (Cape Town) af-south-1, your media file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.
            media: Describes the Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use in your request.
            media-format: Specify the format of your input media file.
            media-sample-rate-hertz: |-
                The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input media file.

                If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe. If there's a mismatch between the value that you specify and the value detected, your job fails. In most cases, you can omit `MediaSampleRateHertz` and let Amazon Transcribe determine the sample rate.
            model-settings: |-
                Specify the custom language model you want to include with your transcription job. If you include `ModelSettings` in your request, you must include the `LanguageModelName` sub-parameter.

                For more information, see [Custom language models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-language-models.html).
            output-bucket-name: |-
                The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcription output stored. Do not include the `S3://` prefix of the specified bucket.

                If you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket, specify it using the `OutputKey` parameter; `OutputBucketName` only accepts the name of a bucket.

                For example, if you want your output stored in `S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`, set `OutputBucketName` to `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`. However, if you want your output stored in `S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/`, set `OutputBucketName` to `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET` and `OutputKey` to `test-files/`.

                Note that Amazon Transcribe must have permission to use the specified location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the [Amazon Web Services Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3). See also [Permissions Required for IAM User Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#auth-role-iam-user).

                If you do not specify `OutputBucketName`, your transcript is placed in a service-managed Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a URI to access your transcript.
            output-encryption-kms-key-id: |-
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key that you want to use to encrypt your transcription output.

                KMS key ARNs have the format `arn:partition:kms:region:account:key/key-id`. For example: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`. For more information, see [KMS key ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-ARN).

                If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

                Note that the role making the request and the role specified in the `DataAccessRoleArn` request parameter (if present) must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
            output-key: |-
                Use in combination with `OutputBucketName` to specify the output location of your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your output file. The default name for your transcription output is the same as the name you specified for your transcription job (`TranscriptionJobName`).

                Here are some examples of how you can use `OutputKey`:

                - If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName` and 'my-transcript.json' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json`.
                - If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the `TranscriptionJobName`, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName`, and 'my-transcript' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json`.
                - If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName` and 'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript.json`.
                - If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the `TranscriptionJobName`, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName`, and 'test-files/my-transcript' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json`.

                If you specify the name of an Amazon S3 bucket sub-folder that doesn't exist, one is created for you.
            settings: |-
                Specify additional optional settings in your request, including channel identification, alternative transcriptions, speaker partitioning. You can use that to apply custom vocabularies and vocabulary filters.

                If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use `Settings` with the `VocabularyName` or `VocabularyFilterName` (or both) sub-parameter.

                If you're using automatic language identification with your request and want to include a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, use instead the `parameter with the LanguageModelName, VocabularyName or VocabularyFilterName sub-parameters.`
            subtitles: Produces subtitle files for your input media. You can specify WebVTT (\*.vtt) and SubRip (\*.srt) formats.
            tags: |-
                Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new transcription job at the time you start this new job.

                To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to [Tagging resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html).
            toxicity-detection: |-
                Enables toxic speech detection in your transcript. If you include `ToxicityDetection` in your request, you must also include `ToxicityCategories`.

                Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.
