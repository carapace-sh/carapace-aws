                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to include in the response. If more results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.
            next-token: An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token for pagination of results from this action. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only results beyond the token, up to the value specified by MaxResults.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            team-id: |-
                The ID of the Microsoft Teams authorized with AWS Chatbot.

                To get the team ID, you must perform the initial authorization flow with Microsoft Teams in the AWS Chatbot console. Then you can copy and paste the team ID from the console. For more information, see [Step 1: Configure a Microsoft Teams client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/teams-setup.html#teams-client-setup) in the *AWS Chatbot Administrator Guide*.
            team-name: The name of the Microsoft Teams Team.

                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: The maximum number of results to include in the response. If more results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.
            next-token: An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token for pagination of results from this action. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only results beyond the token, up to the value specified by MaxResults.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
