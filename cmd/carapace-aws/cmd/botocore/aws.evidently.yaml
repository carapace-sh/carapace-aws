            Creates an Evidently *experiment*. Before you create an experiment, you must create the feature to use for the experiment.

            An experiment helps you make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it by statistical methods, and provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better.

            You can optionally specify a `segment` to have the experiment consider only certain audience types in the experiment, such as using only user sessions from a certain location or who use a certain internet browser.

            Don't use this operation to update an existing experiment. Instead, use [UpdateExperiment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateExperiment.html).

            Creates a *launch* of a given feature. Before you create a launch, you must create the feature to use for the launch.

            You can use a launch to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to more users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.

            Don't use this operation to update an existing launch. Instead, use [UpdateLaunch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateLaunch.html).

A general practice is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results are statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05.
                - `ConfidenceInterval` specifies a confidence interval for the results. The confidence interval represents the range of values for the chosen metric that is likely to contain the true difference between the `baseStat` of a variation and the baseline. Evidently returns the 95% confidence interval.

                - `BaseStat` returns the statistical values collected for the metric for each variation. The statistic uses the same statistic specified in the `baseStat` parameter. Therefore, if `baseStat` is `mean`, this returns the mean of the values collected for each variation.

                Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

                You can associate as many as 50 tags with a project.

        command: |-
            This operation assigns a feature variation to one given user session. You pass in an `entityID` that represents the user. Evidently then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation.

            The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the user's `entityID` matches an override rule, the user is served the variation specified by that rule.

            If there is a current launch with this feature that uses segment overrides, and if the user session's `evaluationContext` matches a segment rule defined in a segment override, the configuration in the segment overrides is used. For more information about segments, see [CreateSegment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSegment.html) and [Use segments to focus your audience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html).

            If there is a launch with no segment overrides, the user might be assigned to a variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in the launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the launch.

            If the user is not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing experiment for this feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in the experiment. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that experiment.

            If the experiment uses a segment, then only user sessions with `evaluationContext` values that match the segment rule are used in the experiment.

            If the user is enrolled in the experiment, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the experiment.

            If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the default variation.

            Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch Evidently resource. Projects, features, launches, and experiments can be tagged.

            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

            Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

            You can use the `TagResource` action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

            You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

            Use this operation to define a *segment* of your audience. A segment is a portion of your audience that share one or more characteristics. Examples could be Chrome browser users, users in Europe, or Firefox browser users in Europe who also fit other criteria that your application collects, such as age.

            Using a segment in an experiment limits that experiment to evaluate only the users who match the segment criteria. Using one or more segments in a launch allows you to define different traffic splits for the different audience segments.

            For more information about segment pattern syntax, see [Segment rule pattern syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html#CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html).

            The pattern that you define for a segment is matched against the value of `evaluationContext`, which is passed into Evidently in the [EvaluateFeature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html) operation, when Evidently assigns a feature variation to a user.

        You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.

        You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features and backend features.
