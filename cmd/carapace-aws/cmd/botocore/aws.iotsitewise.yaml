            Creates an asset model from specified property and hierarchy definitions. You create assets from asset models. With asset models, you can easily create assets of the same type that have standardized definitions. Each asset created from a model inherits the asset model's property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see [Defining asset models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/define-models.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

            You can create three types of asset models, `ASSET_MODEL`, `COMPONENT_MODEL`, or an `INTERFACE`.

            - **ASSET\_MODEL** – (default) An asset model that you can use to create assets. Can't be included as a component in another asset model.
            - **COMPONENT\_MODEL** – A reusable component that you can include in the composite models of other asset models. You can't create assets directly from this type of asset model.
            - **INTERFACE** – An interface is a type of model that defines a standard structure that can be applied to different asset models.

It groups properties (such as attributes, measurements, transforms, and metrics) and child composite models that model parts of your industrial equipment. Each composite model has a type that defines the properties that the composite model supports. Use composite models to define alarms on this asset model.

                When creating custom composite models, you need to use [CreateAssetModelCompositeModel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAssetModelCompositeModel.html). For more information, see [Creating custom composite models (Components)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/create-custom-composite-models.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.
            asset-model-description: A description for the asset model.
            asset-model-external-id: An external ID to assign to the asset model. The external ID must be unique within your Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see [Using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

For more information, see [Asset hierarchies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-hierarchies.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

                You can specify up to 10 hierarchies per asset model. For more information, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/quotas.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.
            asset-model-id: The ID to assign to the asset model, if desired. IoT SiteWise automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this parameter is never required. However, if you prefer to supply your own ID instead, you can specify it here in UUID format. If you specify your own ID, it must be globally unique.
            asset-model-name: A unique name for the asset model.

                You can specify up to 200 properties per asset model. For more information, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/quotas.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

      documentation:
        command: |-
            Sends a list of asset property values to IoT SiteWise. Each value is a timestamp-quality-value (TQV) data point. For more information, see [Ingesting data using the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/ingest-api.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

            To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

            - The `assetId` and `propertyId` of an asset property.
            - A `propertyAlias`, which is a data stream alias (for example, `/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature`). To define an asset property's alias, see [UpdateAssetProperty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html).

            With respect to Unix epoch time, IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no more than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes in the future. IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of \[-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a `TimestampOutOfRangeException` error.

            For each asset property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV `{T1, GOOD, V1}`, then storing `{T1, GOOD, V2}` replaces the existing TQV.

            IoT SiteWise authorizes access to each `BatchPutAssetPropertyValue` entry individually. For more information, see [BatchPutAssetPropertyValue authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-batchputassetpropertyvalue-action) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

            Updates a gateway capability configuration or defines a new capability configuration. Each gateway capability defines data sources for a gateway.

            Important workflow notes:

            Each gateway capability defines data sources for a gateway. This is the namespace of the gateway capability.

            . The namespace follows the format `service:capability:version`, where:

            - `service` - The service providing the capability, or `iotsitewise`.
            - `capability` - The specific capability type. Options include: `opcuacollector` for the OPC UA data source collector, or `publisher` for data publisher capability.
            - `version` - The version number of the capability. Option include `2` for Classic streams, V2 gateways, and `3` for MQTT-enabled, V3 gateways.

            After updating a capability configuration, the sync status becomes `OUT_OF_SYNC` until the gateway processes the configuration.Use `DescribeGatewayCapabilityConfiguration` to check the sync status and verify the configuration was applied.

            A gateway can have multiple capability configurations with different namespaces.
        flag:
            capability-configuration: The JSON document that defines the configuration for the gateway capability. For more information, see [Configuring data sources (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/configure-sources.html#configure-source-cli) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.
            capability-namespace: The namespace of the gateway capability configuration to be updated. For example, if you configure OPC UA sources for an MQTT-enabled gateway, your OPC-UA capability configuration has the namespace `iotsitewise:opcuacollector:3`.

IoT SiteWise computes each interpolated value by using data points from the timestamp of each interval, minus the window to the timestamp of each interval plus the window. If not specified, the window ranges between the start time minus the interval and the end time plus the interval.

                - If you specify a value for the `intervalWindowInSeconds` parameter, the value for the `type` parameter must be `LINEAR_INTERPOLATION`.
                - If a data point isn't found during the specified query window, IoT SiteWise won't return an interpolated value for the interval. This indicates that there's a gap in the ingested data points.

                For example, you can get the interpolated temperature values for a wind turbine every 24 hours over a duration of 7 days. If the interpolation starts on July 1, 2021, at 9 AM with a window of 2 hours, IoT SiteWise uses the data points from 7 AM (9 AM minus 2 hours) to 11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July 2, 2021 to compute the first interpolated value. Next, IoT SiteWise uses the data points from 7 AM (9 AM minus 2 hours) to 11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July 3, 2021 to compute the second interpolated value, and so on.

            Use component-model-based custom composite models to define standard, reusable components. A component-model-based custom composite model consists of a name, a description, and the ID of the component model it references. A component-model-based custom composite model has no properties of its own; its referenced component model provides its associated properties to any created assets. For more information, see [Custom composite models (Components)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/custom-composite-models.html) in the *IoT SiteWise User Guide*.

            Use inline custom composite models to organize the properties of an asset model. The properties of inline custom composite models are local to the asset model where they are included and can't be used to create multiple assets.

            To create a component-model-based model, specify the `composedAssetModelId` of an existing asset model with `assetModelType` of `COMPONENT_MODEL`.

            1. Submit an `UpdateAssetModel` request with the entire existing property removed.
            2. Submit a second `UpdateAssetModel` request that includes the new property. The new asset property will have the same `name` as the previous one and IoT SiteWise will generate a new unique `id`.
