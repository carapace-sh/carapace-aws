      documentation:
        command: Retrieves the properties of the requested container. This request is commonly used to retrieve the endpoint of a container. An endpoint is a value assigned by the service when a new container is created. A container's endpoint does not change after it has been assigned. The `DescribeContainer` request returns a single `Container` object based on `ContainerName`. To return all `Container` objects that are associated with a specified AWS account, use [ListContainers]().

      documentation:

            Sets the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration on a container so that the container can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your AWS Elemental MediaStore container at my.example.container.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability.

            To enable CORS on a container, you attach a CORS policy to the container. In the CORS policy, you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your container. The policy can contain up to 398,000 characters. You can add up to 100 rules to a CORS policy. If more than one rule applies, the service uses the first applicable rule listed.

            To learn more about CORS, see [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in AWS Elemental MediaStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/cors-policy.html).

In this case, the response includes a token. To get the next set of containers, send the command again, this time with the `NextToken` parameter (with the returned token as its value). The next set of responses appears, with a token if there are still more containers to receive.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: Enter the maximum number of containers in the response. Use from 1 to 255 characters.
            next-token: Only if you used `MaxResults` in the first command, enter the token (which was included in the previous response) to obtain the next set of containers. This token is included in a response only if there actually are more containers to list.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.
