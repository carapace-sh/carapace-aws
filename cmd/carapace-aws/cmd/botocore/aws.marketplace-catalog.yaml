            Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single `ChangeSet`, you can't start the same change type against the same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a `ChangeSet` is running, all the entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the change set has completed (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try to start a change set containing a change against an entity that is already locked, you will receive a `ResourceInUseException` error.

            For example, you can't start the `ChangeSet` described in the [example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_StartChangeSet.html#API_StartChangeSet_Examples) later in this topic because it contains two changes to run the same change type (`AddRevisions`) against the same entity (`entity-id@1`).
