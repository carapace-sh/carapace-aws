            next-token: If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken error*.

                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

                A token to specify where to start paginating.

        Amazon Web Services RTB Fabric provides secure, low-latency infrastructure for connecting real-time bidding (RTB) applications. Rather than hosting applications directly, RTB Fabric acts as the connecting fabric that enables your applications to communicate efficiently over private networks instead of the public internet. You maintain complete control over your applications, data, and bidding decisions, while RTB Fabric provides the underlying infrastructure for secure, reliable connectivity.

        You can use these APIs to complete RTB Fabric tasks, such as setting up audit log ingestions or viewing user access. For more information about RTB Fabric, including the required permissions to use the service, see the [Amazon Web Services RTB Fabric User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rtb-fabric/latest/userguide/).
