name: optimize-waypoints
description: '`OptimizeWaypoints` calculates the optimal order to travel between a set of waypoints to minimize either the travel time or the distance travelled during the journey, based on road network restrictions and the traffic pattern data.'
flags:
    --avoid=: Features that are avoided.
    --cli-input-json=: Read arguments from the JSON string provided.
    --cli-input-yaml=: Read arguments from the YAML string provided.
    --clustering=: Clustering allows you to specify how nearby waypoints can be clustered to improve the optimized sequence.
    --departure-time=: Departure time from the waypoint.
    --destination-options=: Destination related options.
    --destination=: 'The final position for the route in the World Geodetic System (WGS 84) format: `[longitude, latitude]`.'
    --driver=: Driver related options.
    --exclude=: Features to be strictly excluded while calculating the route.
    --generate-cli-skeleton: Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request.
    --key=: 'Optional: The API key to be used for authorization.'
    --optimize-sequencing-for=: Specifies the optimization criteria for the calculated sequence.
    --origin-options=: Origin related options.
    --origin=!: The start position for the route.
    --traffic=: Traffic-related options.
    --travel-mode-options=: Travel mode related options for the provided travel mode.
    --travel-mode=: Specifies the mode of transport when calculating a route.
    --waypoints=: List of waypoints between the `Origin` and `Destination`.
