            Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.

            Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the [SearchFaces]() and [SearchFacesByImage]() operations.

            For more information, see Adding faces to a collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            To get the number of faces in a collection, call [DescribeCollection]().

            If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, `IndexFaces` indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.

            If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the `OrientationCorrection` field.

            To determine which version of the model you're using, call [DescribeCollection]() and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of `FaceModelVersion` in the response from `IndexFaces`

            For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            If you provide the optional `ExternalImageId` for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the [ListFaces]() operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.

            You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the `MaxFaces` input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.

            The `QualityFilter` input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, `IndexFaces` chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use `QualityFilter`, to set the quality bar by specifying `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify `NONE`.

            To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call [DescribeCollection]().

            Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of [UnindexedFace]() objects, `UnindexedFaces`. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:

            - The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the `MaxFaces` request parameter.
            - The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.
            - The face is too blurry.
            - The image is too dark.
            - The face has an extreme pose.
            - The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.

            In response, the `IndexFaces` operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, `FaceRecords`. This includes:

            - The bounding box, `BoundingBox`, of the detected face.
            - A confidence value, `Confidence`, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.
            - A face ID, `FaceId`, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.
            - An image ID, `ImageId`, assigned by the service for the input image.

            If you request `ALL` or specific facial attributes (e.g., `FACE_OCCLUDED`) by using the detectionAttributes parameter, Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth), facial occlusion, and other facial attributes.

            If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the `IndexFaces` operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.

            The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

            This operation requires permissions to perform the `rekognition:IndexFaces` action.

A `DEFAULT` subset of facial attributes - `BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Pose`, `Quality`, and `Landmarks` - will always be returned. You can request for specific facial attributes (in addition to the default list) - by using `["DEFAULT", "FACE_OCCLUDED"]` or just `["FACE_OCCLUDED"]`. You can request for all facial attributes by using `["ALL"]`. Requesting more attributes may increase response time.

                If you provide both, `["ALL", "DEFAULT"]`, the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).
            external-image-id: The ID you want to assign to all the faces detected in the image.

                The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes isn't supported.

                If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the `Bytes` field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.
            max-faces: |-
                The maximum number of faces to index. The value of `MaxFaces` must be greater than or equal to 1. `IndexFaces` returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if you specify a larger value for `MaxFaces`.

                If `IndexFaces` detects more faces than the value of `MaxFaces`, the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out first. If there are still more faces than the value of `MaxFaces`, the faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered out (up to the number that's needed to satisfy the value of `MaxFaces`). Information about the unindexed faces is available in the `UnindexedFaces` array.

                The faces that are returned by `IndexFaces` are sorted by the largest face bounding box size to the smallest size, in descending order.

                `MaxFaces` can be used with a collection associated with any version of the face model.
            quality-filter: |-
                A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't indexed. If you specify `AUTO`, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`, filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is `AUTO`. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed.

                To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.

            Lists the entries (images) within a dataset. An entry is a JSON Line that contains the information for a single image, including the image location, assigned labels, and object location bounding boxes. For more information, see [Creating a manifest file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/md-manifest-files.html).

            JSON Lines in the response include information about non-terminal errors found in the dataset. Non terminal errors are reported in `errors` lists within each JSON Line. The same information is reported in the training and testing validation result manifests that Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels creates during model training.

            Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image. For more information, see Recognizing celebrities in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            `RecognizeCelebrities` returns the 64 largest faces in the image. It lists the recognized celebrities in the `CelebrityFaces` array and any unrecognized faces in the `UnrecognizedFaces` array. `RecognizeCelebrities` doesn't return celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest 64 faces in the image.

            For each celebrity recognized, `RecognizeCelebrities` returns a `Celebrity` object. The `Celebrity` object contains the celebrity name, ID, URL links to additional information, match confidence, and a `ComparedFace` object that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the image.

            Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain information about which images a celebrity has been recognized in. Your application must store this information and use the `Celebrity` ID property as a unique identifier for the celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or additional information URLs returned by `RecognizeCelebrities`, you will need the ID to identify the celebrity in a call to the [GetCelebrityInfo]() operation.

            You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

            For an example, see Recognizing celebrities in an image in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            For an example, see Analyzing images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

            **Optional Parameters**

            You can specify one or both of the `GENERAL_LABELS` and `IMAGE_PROPERTIES` feature types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including `GENERAL_LABELS` will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input image, while including `IMAGE_PROPERTIES`will ensure the response includes information about the image quality and color.

            When using `GENERAL_LABELS` and/or `IMAGE_PROPERTIES` you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering see [Detecting Labels in an Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/labels-detect-labels-image.html).

            When getting labels, you can specify `MinConfidence` to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the `MaxLabels` parameter to limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels. These arguments are only valid when supplying GENERAL\_LABELS as a feature type.

            **Response Elements**

            For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API returns the following types of information about labels:

            - Name - The name of the detected label.
            - Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.
            - Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.
            - Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.
            - Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.
            - BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.

            The API returns the following information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure:

            - Quality - Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast of the input image, scored between 0 to 100. Image quality is returned for the entire image, as well as the background and the foreground.
            - Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image.
            - Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s foreground.
            - Background - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s background.

            The list of returned labels will include at least one label for every detected object, along with information about that label. In the following example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as well as the confidence in the label:

            `{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}`

            `{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}`

            `{Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}`

            The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.

            `{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}`

            `{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}`

            `{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}`

            In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.

            If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the [DetectFaces]() operation provides.

            This is a stateless API operation that doesn't return any data.

            This operation requires permissions to perform the `rekognition:DetectLabels` action.

            Gets the face search results for Amazon Rekognition Video face search started by [StartFaceSearch](). The search returns faces in a collection that match the faces of persons detected in a video. It also includes the time(s) that faces are matched in the video.

            Face search in a video is an asynchronous operation. You start face search by calling to [StartFaceSearch]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the search operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartFaceSearch`. To get the search results, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call `GetFaceSearch` and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartFaceSearch`.

            For more information, see Searching Faces in a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            The search results are retured in an array, `Persons`, of [PersonMatch]() objects. Each`PersonMatch` element contains details about the matching faces in the input collection, person information (facial attributes, bounding boxes, and person identifer) for the matched person, and the time the person was matched in the video.

            `GetFaceSearch` only returns the default facial attributes (`BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Landmarks`, `Pose`, and `Quality`). The other facial attributes listed in the `Face` object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            By default, the `Persons` array is sorted by the time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, persons are matched. You can also sort by persons by specifying `INDEX` for the `SORTBY` input parameter.

            Amazon Rekognition Video can detect segments in a video stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use [Video]() to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. `StartSegmentDetection` returns a job identifier (`JobId`) which you use to get the results of the operation. When segment detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in `NotificationChannel`.

            You can use the `Filters` ([StartSegmentDetectionFilters]()) input parameter to specify the minimum detection confidence returned in the response. Within `Filters`, use `ShotFilter` ([StartShotDetectionFilter]()) to filter detected shots. Use `TechnicalCueFilter` ([StartTechnicalCueDetectionFilter]()) to filter technical cues.

            To get the results of the segment detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. if so, call [GetSegmentDetection]() and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartSegmentDetection`.

            Amazon Rekognition Video inappropriate or offensive content detection in a stored video is an asynchronous operation. You start analysis by calling [StartContentModeration]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When analysis finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartContentModeration`. To get the results of the content analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call `GetContentModeration` and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartContentModeration`.

            For more information, see Working with Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Devlopers Guide.

            `GetContentModeration` returns detected inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content moderation labels, and the time they are detected, in an array, `ModerationLabels`, of [ContentModerationDetection]() objects.

            By default, the moderated labels are returned sorted by time, in milliseconds from the start of the video. You can also sort them by moderated label by specifying `NAME` for the `SortBy` input parameter.

            Since video analysis can return a large number of results, use the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of labels returned in a single call to `GetContentModeration`. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetContentModeration` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the value of `NextToken` returned from the previous call to `GetContentModeration`.

            For a given input image, first detects the largest face in the image, and then searches the specified collection for matching faces. The operation compares the features of the input face with faces in the specified collection.

            To search for all faces in an input image, you might first call the [IndexFaces]() operation, and then use the face IDs returned in subsequent calls to the [SearchFaces]() operation.

            You can also call the `DetectFaces` operation and use the bounding boxes in the response to make face crops, which then you can pass in to the `SearchFacesByImage` operation.

            You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

            The response returns an array of faces that match, ordered by similarity score with the highest similarity first. More specifically, it is an array of metadata for each face match found. Along with the metadata, the response also includes a `similarity` indicating how similar the face is to the input face. In the response, the operation also returns the bounding box (and a confidence level that the bounding box contains a face) of the face that Amazon Rekognition used for the input image.

            If no faces are detected in the input image, `SearchFacesByImage` returns an `InvalidParameterException` error.

            For an example, Searching for a Face Using an Image in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            The `QualityFilter` input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use `QualityFilter` to set the quality bar for filtering by specifying `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify `NONE`. The default value is `NONE`.

            To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call [DescribeCollection]().

The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed. The default value is `NONE`.

                To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.

            Gets the celebrity recognition results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by [StartCelebrityRecognition]().

            Celebrity recognition in a video is an asynchronous operation. Analysis is started by a call to [StartCelebrityRecognition]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`).

            When the celebrity recognition operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartCelebrityRecognition`. To get the results of the celebrity recognition analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call `GetCelebrityDetection` and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartCelebrityDetection`.

            For more information, see Working With Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            `GetCelebrityRecognition` returns detected celebrities and the time(s) they are detected in an array (`Celebrities`) of [CelebrityRecognition]() objects. Each `CelebrityRecognition` contains information about the celebrity in a [CelebrityDetail]() object and the time, `Timestamp`, the celebrity was detected. This [CelebrityDetail]() object stores information about the detected celebrity's face attributes, a face bounding box, known gender, the celebrity's name, and a confidence estimate.

            `GetCelebrityRecognition` only returns the default facial attributes (`BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Landmarks`, `Pose`, and `Quality`). The `BoundingBox` field only applies to the detected face instance. The other facial attributes listed in the `Face` object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            By default, the `Celebrities` array is sorted by time (milliseconds from the start of the video). You can also sort the array by celebrity by specifying the value `ID` in the `SortBy` input parameter.

            The `CelebrityDetail` object includes the celebrity identifer and additional information urls. If you don't store the additional information urls, you can get them later by calling [GetCelebrityInfo]() with the celebrity identifer.

            No information is returned for faces not recognized as celebrities.

            Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetCelebrityDetection` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetCelebrityRecognition`.

            Gets face detection results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by [StartFaceDetection]().

            Face detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous operation. You start face detection by calling [StartFaceDetection]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the face detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartFaceDetection`. To get the results of the face detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call [GetFaceDetection]() and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartFaceDetection`.

            `GetFaceDetection` returns an array of detected faces (`Faces`) sorted by the time the faces were detected.

            Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetFaceDetection` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetFaceDetection`.

            Note that for the `GetFaceDetection` operation, the returned values for `FaceOccluded` and `EyeDirection` will always be "null".

            Gets the path tracking results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by [StartPersonTracking]().

            The person path tracking operation is started by a call to `StartPersonTracking` which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartPersonTracking`.

            To get the results of the person path tracking operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call [GetPersonTracking]() and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartPersonTracking`.

            `GetPersonTracking` returns an array, `Persons`, of tracked persons and the time(s) their paths were tracked in the video.

            `GetPersonTracking` only returns the default facial attributes (`BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Landmarks`, `Pose`, and `Quality`). The other facial attributes listed in the `Face` object of the following response syntax are not returned.

            For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            By default, the array is sorted by the time(s) a person's path is tracked in the video. You can sort by tracked persons by specifying `INDEX` for the `SortBy` input parameter.

            Use the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of items returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetPersonTracking` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetPersonTracking`.

            To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to create a resource-based policy known as a *project policy*. You attach the project policy to the source project by calling [PutProjectPolicy](). The project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trusting AWS account to a trusted account.

            For more information creating and attaching a project policy, see Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the *Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide*.

            If you are copying a model version to a project in the same AWS account, you don't need to create a project policy.

            Copying project versions is supported only for Custom Labels models.

            To copy a model, the destination project, source project, and source model version must already exist.

            Copying a model version takes a while to complete. To get the current status, call [DescribeProjectVersions]() and check the value of `Status` in the [ProjectVersionDescription]() object. The copy operation has finished when the value of `Status` is `COPYING_COMPLETED`.

            Gets the text detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by [StartTextDetection]().

            Text detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous operation. You start text detection by calling [StartTextDetection]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`) When the text detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartTextDetection`. To get the results of the text detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. if so, call `GetTextDetection` and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call of `StartLabelDetection`.

            `GetTextDetection` returns an array of detected text (`TextDetections`) sorted by the time the text was detected, up to 100 words per frame of video.

            Each element of the array includes the detected text, the precentage confidence in the acuracy of the detected text, the time the text was detected, bounding box information for where the text was located, and unique identifiers for words and their lines.

            Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of text detections returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetTextDetection` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetTextDetection`.

            Pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.

            The `DetectText` operation returns text in an array of [TextDetection]() elements, `TextDetections`. Each `TextDetection` element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.

            A word is one or more script characters that are not separated by spaces. `DetectText` can detect up to 100 words in an image.

            A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the `DetectText` operation returns multiple lines.

            To determine whether a `TextDetection` element is a line of text or a word, use the `TextDetection` object `Type` field.

            To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis.

            For more information, see Detecting text in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            - Face cover
            - Hand cover
            - Head cover

            You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. The image must be either a PNG or JPG formatted file.

            `DetectProtectiveEquipment` detects PPE worn by up to 15 persons detected in an image.

            For each person detected in the image the API returns an array of body parts (face, head, left-hand, right-hand). For each body part, an array of detected items of PPE is returned, including an indicator of whether or not the PPE covers the body part. The API returns the confidence it has in each detection (person, PPE, body part and body part coverage). It also returns a bounding box ([BoundingBox]()) for each detected person and each detected item of PPE.

            You can optionally request a summary of detected PPE items with the `SummarizationAttributes` input parameter. The summary provides the following information.

            - The persons detected as wearing all of the types of PPE that you specify.
            - The persons detected as not wearing all of the types PPE that you specify.
            - The persons detected where PPE adornment could not be determined.

            This operation applies only to Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels.

            Detects custom labels in a supplied image by using an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model.

            You specify which version of a model version to use by using the `ProjectVersionArn` input parameter.

            You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

            For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (`CustomLabel`) object in an array (`CustomLabels`). Each `CustomLabel` object provides the label name (`Name`), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (`Confidence`), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (`Geometry`).

            To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for `MinConfidence`. `DetectCustomLabelsLabels` only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the specified value. The value of `MinConfidence` maps to the assumed threshold values created during training. For more information, see *Assumed threshold* in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels metrics expresses an assumed threshold as a floating point value between 0-1. The range of `MinConfidence` normalizes the threshold value to a percentage value (0-100). Confidence responses from `DetectCustomLabels` are also returned as a percentage. You can use `MinConfidence` to change the precision and recall or your model. For more information, see *Analyzing an image* in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide.

            If you don't specify a value for `MinConfidence`, `DetectCustomLabels` returns labels based on the assumed threshold of each label.

            This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.

            This operation requires permissions to perform the `rekognition:DetectCustomLabels` action.

            Compares a face in the *source* input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the *target* input image.

            If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.

            CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use `CompareFaces` to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.

            You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

            In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.

            By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the `SimilarityThreshold` parameter.

            `CompareFaces` also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.

            The `QualityFilter` input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use `QualityFilter` to set the quality bar by specifying `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify `NONE`. The default value is `NONE`.

            If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, `CompareFaces` returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.

            If no faces are detected in the source or target images, `CompareFaces` returns an `InvalidParameterException` error.

            This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.

            For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

            This operation requires permissions to perform the `rekognition:CompareFaces` action.

The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed. The default value is `NONE`.

                To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.

            Gets the label detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by [StartLabelDetection]().

            The label detection operation is started by a call to [StartLabelDetection]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the label detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartlabelDetection`.

            To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call [GetLabelDetection]() and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartLabelDetection`.

            `GetLabelDetection` returns an array of detected labels (`Labels`) sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can also sort by the label name by specifying `NAME` for the `SortBy` input parameter. If there is no `NAME` specified, the default sort is by timestamp.

            You can select how results are aggregated by using the `AggregateBy` input parameter. The default aggregation method is `TIMESTAMPS`. You can also aggregate by `SEGMENTS`, which aggregates all instances of labels detected in a given segment.

            The returned Labels array may include the following attributes:

            - Name - The name of the detected label.
            - Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.
            - Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. GetLabelDetection returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.
            - Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.
            - Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.
            - BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.
            - Timestamp - Time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was detected. For aggregation by `SEGMENTS`, the `StartTimestampMillis`, `EndTimestampMillis`, and `DurationMillis` structures are what define a segment. Although the “Timestamp” structure is still returned with each label, its value is set to be the same as `StartTimestampMillis`.

            Timestamp and Bounding box information are returned for detected Instances, only if aggregation is done by `TIMESTAMPS`. If aggregating by `SEGMENTS`, information about detected instances isn’t returned.

            The version of the label model used for the detection is also returned.

            **Note `DominantColors` isn't returned for `Instances`, although it is shown as part of the response in the sample seen below.**

            Use `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetlabelDetection` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetLabelDetection`.

            If you are retrieving results while using the Amazon Simple Notification Service, note that you will receive an "ERROR" notification if the job encounters an issue.

            Gets the segment detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by [StartSegmentDetection]().

            Segment detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous operation. You start segment detection by calling [StartSegmentDetection]() which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the segment detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartSegmentDetection`. To get the results of the segment detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. if so, call `GetSegmentDetection` and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call of `StartSegmentDetection`.

            `GetSegmentDetection` returns detected segments in an array (`Segments`) of [SegmentDetection]() objects. `Segments` is sorted by the segment types specified in the `SegmentTypes` input parameter of `StartSegmentDetection`. Each element of the array includes the detected segment, the precentage confidence in the acuracy of the detected segment, the type of the segment, and the frame in which the segment was detected.

            Use `SelectedSegmentTypes` to find out the type of segment detection requested in the call to `StartSegmentDetection`.

            Use the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of segment detections returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetSegmentDetection` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetSegmentDetection`.

            Associates one or more faces with an existing UserID. Takes an array of `FaceIds`. Each `FaceId` that are present in the `FaceIds` list is associated with the provided UserID. The number of FaceIds that can be used as input in a single request is limited to 100.

            Note that the total number of faces that can be associated with a single `UserID` is also limited to 100. Once a `UserID` has 100 faces associated with it, no additional faces can be added. If more API calls are made after the limit is reached, a `ServiceQuotaExceededException` will result.

            The `UserMatchThreshold` parameter specifies the minimum user match confidence required for the face to be associated with a UserID that has at least one `FaceID` already associated. This ensures that the `FaceIds` are associated with the right UserID. The value ranges from 0-100 and default value is 75.

            If successful, an array of `AssociatedFace` objects containing the associated `FaceIds` is returned. If a given face is already associated with the given `UserID`, it will be ignored and will not be returned in the response. If a given face is already associated to a different `UserID`, isn't found in the collection, doesn’t meet the `UserMatchThreshold`, or there are already 100 faces associated with the `UserID`, it will be returned as part of an array of `UnsuccessfulFaceAssociations.`

            The `UserStatus` reflects the status of an operation which updates a UserID representation with a list of given faces. The `UserStatus` can be:

            - ACTIVE - All associations or disassociations of FaceID(s) for a UserID are complete.
            - CREATED - A UserID has been created, but has no FaceID(s) associated with it.

            You can use the `OutputConfig` option in the Settings parameter to provide an Amazon S3 bucket location. The Amazon S3 bucket stores reference images and audit images. If no Amazon S3 bucket is defined, raw bytes are sent instead.

            You can use `AuditImagesLimit` to limit the number of audit images returned when `GetFaceLivenessSessionResults` is called. This number is between 0 and 4. By default, it is set to 0. The limit is best effort and based on the duration of the selfie-video.

            Attaches a project policy to a Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project in a trusting AWS account. A project policy specifies that a trusted AWS account can copy a model version from a trusting AWS account to a project in the trusted AWS account. To copy a model version you use the [CopyProjectVersion]() operation. Only applies to Custom Labels projects.

            For more information about the format of a project policy document, see Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the *Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide*.

            The response from `PutProjectPolicy` is a revision ID for the project policy. You can attach multiple project policies to a project. You can also update an existing project policy by specifying the policy revision ID of the existing policy.

            To remove a project policy from a project, call [DeleteProjectPolicy](). To get a list of project policies attached to a project, call [ListProjectPolicies]().

            You copy a model version by calling [CopyProjectVersion]().

            To get the results of the content analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call [GetContentModeration]() and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartContentModeration`.

            Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

            Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

            The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use [Video]() to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. `StartLabelDetection` returns a job identifier (`JobId`) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in `NotificationChannel`.

            To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call [GetLabelDetection]() and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartLabelDetection`.

            *Optional Parameters*

            `StartLabelDetection` has the `GENERAL_LABELS` Feature applied by default. This feature allows you to provide filtering criteria to the `Settings` parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering, see [Detecting labels in a video](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/labels-detecting-labels-video.html).

            You can specify `MinConfidence` to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 50.

            Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.

            `DetectFaces` detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details. These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), pose, presence of facial occlusion, and so on.

            The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence.

            You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

            This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.

You can request for all facial attributes by using \[`"ALL"]`. Requesting more attributes may increase response time.

            Creates an Amazon Rekognition stream processor that you can use to detect and recognize faces or to detect labels in a streaming video.

            Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. There are two different settings for stream processors in Amazon Rekognition: detecting faces and detecting labels.

            - If you are creating a stream processor for detecting faces, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (`Input`) and a Kinesis data stream (`Output`) stream for receiving the output. You must use the `FaceSearch` option in `Settings`, specifying the collection that contains the faces you want to recognize. After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use [StopStreamProcessor]() to stop processing.
            - If you are creating a stream processor to detect labels, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (`Input`), Amazon S3 bucket information (`Output`), and an Amazon SNS topic ARN (`NotificationChannel`). You can also provide a KMS key ID to encrypt the data sent to your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify what you want to detect by using the `ConnectedHome` option in settings, and selecting one of the following: `PERSON`, `PET`, `PACKAGE`, `ALL` You can also specify where in the frame you want Amazon Rekognition to monitor with `RegionsOfInterest`. When you run the [StartStreamProcessor]() operation on a label detection stream processor, you input start and stop information to determine the length of the processing time.

            Use `Name` to assign an identifier for the stream processor. You use `Name` to manage the stream processor. For example, you can start processing the source video by calling [StartStreamProcessor]() with the `Name` field.

            This operation requires permissions to perform the `rekognition:CreateStreamProcessor` action. If you want to tag your stream processor, you also require permission to perform the `rekognition:TagResource` operation.

            input: Kinesis video stream stream that provides the source streaming video. If you are using the AWS CLI, the parameter name is `StreamProcessorInput`. This is required for both face search and label detection stream processors.
            kms-key-id: The identifier for your AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS key). This is an optional parameter for label detection stream processors and should not be used to create a face search stream processor. You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key, the ID of your KMS key, an alias for your KMS key, or an alias ARN. The key is used to encrypt results and data published to your Amazon S3 bucket, which includes image frames and hero images. Your source images are unaffected.
            name: An identifier you assign to the stream processor. You can use `Name` to manage the stream processor. For example, you can get the current status of the stream processor by calling [DescribeStreamProcessor](). `Name` is idempotent. This is required for both face search and label detection stream processors.
            notification-channel: ""
            regions-of-interest: Specifies locations in the frames where Amazon Rekognition checks for objects or people. You can specify up to 10 regions of interest, and each region has either a polygon or a bounding box. This is an optional parameter for label detection stream processors and should not be used to create a face search stream processor.
            role-arn: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role that allows access to the stream processor. The IAM role provides Rekognition read permissions for a Kinesis stream. It also provides write permissions to an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon Simple Notification Service topic for a label detection stream processor. This is required for both face search and label detection stream processors.
            settings: Input parameters used in a streaming video analyzed by a stream processor. You can use `FaceSearch` to recognize faces in a streaming video, or you can use `ConnectedHome` to detect labels.
            stream-processor-output: Kinesis data stream stream or Amazon S3 bucket location to which Amazon Rekognition Video puts the analysis results. If you are using the AWS CLI, the parameter name is `StreamProcessorOutput`. This must be a [S3Destination]() of an Amazon S3 bucket that you own for a label detection stream processor or a Kinesis data stream ARN for a face search stream processor.
            tags: A set of tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to the stream processor.
