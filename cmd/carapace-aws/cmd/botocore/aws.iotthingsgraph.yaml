For Greengrass deployments, it updates the Greengrass group that is specified by the `greengrassGroupName` parameter. It also adds a file to the S3 bucket specified by the `s3BucketName` parameter. You need to call `DeploySystemInstance` after running this action.

            For Greengrass deployments, since this action modifies and adds resources to a Greengrass group and an S3 bucket on the caller's behalf, the calling identity must have write permissions to both the specified Greengrass group and S3 bucket. Otherwise, the call will fail with an authorization error.

            Asynchronously uploads one or more entity definitions to the user's namespace. The `document` parameter is required if `syncWithPublicNamespace` and `deleteExistingEntites` are false. If the `syncWithPublicNamespace` parameter is set to `true`, the user's namespace will synchronize with the latest version of the public namespace. If `deprecateExistingEntities` is set to true, all entities in the latest version will be deleted before the new `DefinitionDocument` is uploaded.

            When a user uploads entity definitions for the first time, the service creates a new namespace for the user. The new namespace tracks the public namespace. Currently users can have only one namespace. The namespace version increments whenever a user uploads entity definitions that are backwards-incompatible and whenever a user sets the `syncWithPublicNamespace` parameter or the `deprecateExistingEntities` parameter to `true`.

            The IDs for all of the entities should be in URN format. Each entity must be in the user's namespace. Users can't create entities in the public namespace, but entity definitions can refer to entities in the public namespace.

            Valid entities are `Device`, `DeviceModel`, `Service`, `Capability`, `State`, `Action`, `Event`, `Property`, `Mapping`, `Enum`.

        AWS IoT Things Graph

        AWS IoT Things Graph provides an integrated set of tools that enable developers to connect devices and services that use different standards, such as units of measure and communication protocols. AWS IoT Things Graph makes it possible to build IoT applications with little to no code by connecting devices and services and defining how they interact at an abstract level.

        For more information about how AWS IoT Things Graph works, see the [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/thingsgraph/latest/ug/iot-tg-whatis.html).

        The AWS IoT Things Graph service is discontinued.
