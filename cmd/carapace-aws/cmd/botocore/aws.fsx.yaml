            Lists tags for Amazon FSx resources.

            When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain, Amazon FSx returns a `NextToken` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the `NextToken` request parameter set to the value of `NextToken` from the last response.

            This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your tags. `ListTagsForResource` is called first without a `NextToken`value. Then the action continues to be called with the `NextToken` parameter set to the value of the last `NextToken` value until a response has no `NextToken`.

            When using this action, keep the following in mind:

            - The implementation might return fewer than `MaxResults` file system descriptions while still including a `NextToken` value.
            - The order of tags returned in the response of one `ListTagsForResource` call and the order of tags returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

            Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP volume, or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. We recommend creating regular backups so that you can restore a file system or volume from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system or volume.

            For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems that have the following configuration:

            - A Persistent deployment type
            - Are *not* linked to a data repository

            For more information about backups, see the following:

            - For Amazon FSx for Lustre, see [Working with FSx for Lustre backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html).
            - For Amazon FSx for Windows, see [Working with FSx for Windows backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html).
            - For Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, see [Working with FSx for NetApp ONTAP backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/using-backups.html).
            - For Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, see [Working with FSx for OpenZFS backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/using-backups.html).

            If a backup with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup with the specified client request token exists and the parameters don't match, this operation returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a backup with the specified client request token doesn't exist, `CreateBackup` does the following:

            - Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.
            - Returns the description of the backup.

            By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateBackup` operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.

            The `CreateBackup` operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still `CREATING`. You can check the backup creation status by calling the [DescribeBackups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeBackups.html) operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.

                - For `SCRATCH_2`, `PERSISTENT_1`, and `PERSISTENT_2 SSD` deployment types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must be greater than the current storage capacity.
                - For `PERSISTENT HDD` file systems, valid values are multiples of 6000 GiB for 12-MBps throughput per TiB file systems and multiples of 1800 GiB for 40-MBps throughput per TiB file systems. The values must be greater than the current storage capacity.
                - For `SCRATCH_1` file systems, you can't increase the storage capacity.

                For more information, see [Managing storage and throughput capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the *FSx for Lustre User Guide*.

                For FSx for OpenZFS file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. For more information, see [Managing storage capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the *FSx for OpenZFS User Guide*.

                For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. To increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16 MBps of throughput capacity. For more information, see [Managing storage capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the *Amazon FSxfor Windows File Server User Guide*.

                For ONTAP file systems, when increasing storage capacity, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. When decreasing storage capacity on second-generation file systems, the target value must be at least 9 percent smaller than the current SSD storage capacity. For more information, see [File system storage capacity and IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/storage-capacity-and-IOPS.html) in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.

            You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-Region disaster recovery. You can periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your Amazon Web Services partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. Amazon Web Services currently has three partitions: `aws` (Standard Regions), `aws-cn` (China Regions), and `aws-us-gov` (Amazon Web Services GovCloud \[US] Regions).

            You can also use backup copies to clone your file dataset to another Region or within the same Region.

            You can use the `SourceRegion` parameter to specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the `us-west-1` Region and want to copy a backup from the `us-east-2` Region, you specify `us-east-2` in the `SourceRegion` parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

            For more information about creating backup copies, see [Copying backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups) in the *Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide*, [Copying backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html#copy-backups) in the *Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide*, and [Copying backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups) in the *Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide*.

        command: |-
            Creates a snapshot of an existing Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume. With snapshots, you can easily undo file changes and compare file versions by restoring the volume to a previous version.

            If a snapshot with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a snapshot with the specified client request token doesn't exist, `CreateSnapshot` does the following:

            - Creates a new OpenZFS snapshot with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.
            - Returns the description of the snapshot.

            By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateSnapshot` operation without the risk of creating an extra snapshot. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a snapshot was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a snapshot, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.

            The `CreateSnapshot` operation returns while the snapshot's lifecycle state is still `CREATING`. You can check the snapshot creation status by calling the [DescribeSnapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSnapshots.html) operation, which returns the snapshot state along with other information.

For more information, see [Working with DNS Aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html) and [Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/walkthrough05-file-system-custom-CNAME.html), including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias.

            Deletes a file system. After deletion, the file system no longer exists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic backups and snapshots are also deleted.

            To delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the file system. Then provide a `FileSystemId` value to the `DeleteFileSystem` operation.

            Before deleting an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system, make sure that there aren't any Amazon S3 access points attached to any volume. For more information on how to list S3 access points that are attached to volumes, see [Listing S3 access point attachments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/access-points-list.html). For more information on how to delete S3 access points, see [Deleting an S3 access point attachment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/delete-access-point.html).

            By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup isn't subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted.

            To delete an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, first [unmount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/unmounting-fs.html) it from every connected Amazon EC2 instance, then provide a `FileSystemId` value to the `DeleteFileSystem` operation. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup when the `DeleteFileSystem` operation is invoked. On file systems not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, set `SkipFinalBackup` to `false` to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. Backups cannot be enabled on S3-linked file systems. To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the [AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#auto-import-export-metrics) metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an [export data repository task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/export-data-repo-task-dra.html). If you have automatic export enabled and want to use an export data repository task, you have to disable automatic export before executing the export data repository task.

            The `DeleteFileSystem` operation returns while the file system has the `DELETING` status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the [DescribeFileSystems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeFileSystems.html) operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the `DescribeFileSystems` operation returns a `FileSystemNotFound` error.

            If a data repository task is in a `PENDING` or `EXECUTING` state, deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).

            The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.

            Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx file systems, if a `FileSystemIds` value is provided for that file system. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

            When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon FSx returns a `NextToken` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the `NextToken` request parameter set to the value of `NextToken` from the last response.

            This operation is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your file system descriptions. `DescribeFileSystems` is called first without a `NextToken`value. Then the operation continues to be called with the `NextToken` parameter set to the value of the last `NextToken` value until a response has no `NextToken`.

            When using this operation, keep the following in mind:

            - The implementation might return fewer than `MaxResults` file system descriptions while still including a `NextToken` value.
            - The order of file systems returned in the response of one `DescribeFileSystems` call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multicall iteration is unspecified.

            Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx for OpenZFS snapshots, if a `SnapshotIds` value is provided. Otherwise, this operation returns all snapshots owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

            When retrieving all snapshots, you can optionally specify the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of snapshots in a response. If more backups remain, Amazon FSx returns a `NextToken` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the `NextToken` request parameter set to the value of `NextToken` from the last response.

            Use this operation in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your snapshots. `DescribeSnapshots` is called first without a `NextToken` value. Then the operation continues to be called with the `NextToken` parameter set to the value of the last `NextToken` value until a response has no `NextToken` value.

            When using this operation, keep the following in mind:

            - The operation might return fewer than the `MaxResults` value of snapshot descriptions while still including a `NextToken` value.
            - The order of snapshots returned in the response of one `DescribeSnapshots` call and the order of backups returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

            Creates a new Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system from an existing Amazon FSx backup.

            If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the file system. If a file system with the specified client request token exists but the parameters don't match, this call returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, this operation does the following:

            - Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.
            - Returns the description of the file system.

            Parameters like the Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply other settings.

            By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateFileSystemFromBackup` call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives a success message as long as the parameters are the same.

            The `CreateFileSystemFromBackup` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still `CREATING`. You can check the file-system creation status by calling the [DescribeFileSystems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeFileSystems.html) operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.

However, the value that you specify must be equal to or greater than the backup's storage capacity value. If you don't use the `StorageCapacity` parameter, the default is the backup's `StorageCapacity` value.

                If used to create a file system other than OpenZFS, you must provide a value that matches the backup's `StorageCapacity` value. If you provide any other value, Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 Bad Request.

                - Set to `SSD` to use solid state drive storage. SSD is supported on all Windows and OpenZFS deployment types.
                - Set to `HDD` to use hard disk drive storage. HDD is supported on `SINGLE_AZ_2` and `MULTI_AZ_1` FSx for Windows File Server file system deployment types.
                - Set to `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` to use fully elastic, intelligently-tiered storage. Intelligent-Tiering is only available for OpenZFS file systems with the Multi-AZ deployment type and for Lustre file systems with the Persistent\_2 deployment type.

                The default value is `SSD`.

                HDD and SSD storage types have different minimum storage capacity requirements. A restored file system's storage capacity is tied to the file system that was backed up. You can create a file system that uses HDD storage from a backup of a file system that used SSD storage if the original SSD file system had a storage capacity of at least 2000 GiB.

            Creates a new Amazon File Cache resource.

            You can use this operation with a client request token in the request that Amazon File Cache uses to ensure idempotent creation. If a cache with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, `CreateFileCache` returns the description of the existing cache. If a cache with the specified client request token exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a file cache with the specified client request token doesn't exist, `CreateFileCache` does the following:

            - Creates a new, empty Amazon File Cache resource with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.
            - Returns the description of the cache in JSON format.

            The `CreateFileCache` call returns while the cache's lifecycle state is still `CREATING`. You can check the cache creation status by calling the [DescribeFileCaches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeFileCaches.html) operation, which returns the cache state along with other information.

                Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
                The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by --generate-cli-skeleton.
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values.
                It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.

            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: ""
            names: The names of the S3 access point attachments whose descriptions you want to retrieve.
            next-token: ""
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
