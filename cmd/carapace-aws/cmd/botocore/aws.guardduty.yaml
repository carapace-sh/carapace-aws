        command: |-
            Creates member accounts of the current Amazon Web Services account by specifying a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs. This step is a prerequisite for managing the associated member accounts either by invitation or through an organization.

            As a delegated administrator, using `CreateMembers` will enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with the exception of the organization delegated administrator account. A delegated administrator must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member.

            When you use CreateMembers as an Organizations delegated administrator, GuardDuty applies your organization's auto-enable settings to the member accounts in this request, irrespective of the accounts being new or existing members. For more information about the existing auto-enable settings for your organization, see [DescribeOrganizationConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConfiguration.html).

            If you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation, the member account details obtained from this API, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the [InviteMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers.html) API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the [DeleteMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html) API.

            When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disassociated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMembers API. You can create an association with these member accounts again only by calling the CreateMembers API.

                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: You can use this parameter to indicate the maximum number of items that you want in the response. The default value is 50. The maximum value is 50.
            next-token: You can use this parameter when paginating results. Set the value of this parameter to null on your first call to the list action. For subsequent calls to the action, fill nextToken in the request with the value of NextToken from the previous response to continue listing data.

                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

            Creates a single GuardDuty detector. A detector is a resource that represents the GuardDuty service. To start using GuardDuty, you must create a detector in each Region where you enable the service. You can have only one detector per account per Region. All data sources are enabled in a new detector by default.

            - When you don't specify any `features`, with an exception to `RUNTIME_MONITORING`, all the optional features are enabled by default.
            - When you specify some of the `features`, any feature that is not specified in the API call gets enabled by default, with an exception to `RUNTIME_MONITORING`.

            Specifying both EKS Runtime Monitoring (`EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING`) and Runtime Monitoring (`RUNTIME_MONITORING`) will cause an error. You can add only one of these two features because Runtime Monitoring already includes the threat detection for Amazon EKS resources.

            Invites Amazon Web Services accounts to become members of an organization administered by the Amazon Web Services account that invokes this API. If you are using Amazon Web Services Organizations to manage your GuardDuty environment, this step is not needed. For more information, see [Managing accounts with organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html).

            To invite Amazon Web Services accounts, the first step is to ensure that GuardDuty has been enabled in the potential member accounts. You can now invoke this API to add accounts by invitation. The invited accounts can either accept or decline the invitation from their GuardDuty accounts. Each invited Amazon Web Services account can choose to accept the invitation from only one Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see [Managing GuardDuty accounts by invitation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_invitations.html).

            After the invite has been accepted and you choose to disassociate a member account (by using [DisassociateMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateMembers.html)) from your account, the details of the member account obtained by invoking [CreateMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html), including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that you can invoke InviteMembers without the need to invoke [CreateMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html) again. To remove the details associated with a member account, you must also invoke [DeleteMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html).

            If you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation, the member account details obtained from this API, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the [InviteMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers.html) API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the [DeleteMembers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html) API.

            When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disassociated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMembers API. You can create an association with these member accounts again only by calling the CreateMembers API.

            generate-cli-skeleton: |-
                If other arguments are provided on the command line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.
                This may  not  be  specified  along with --cli-input-yaml.
            max-items: |-
                The total number of items to return in the command's output.
                If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output.
                To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent  command.
                Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            max-results: You can use this parameter to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. The default value is 50.
            next-token: You can use this parameter when paginating results. Set the value of this parameter to null on your first call to the list action. For subsequent calls to the action, fill nextToken in the request with the value of NextToken from the previous response to continue listing data.
            page-size: |-
                The size of each page to get in the AWS service call.
                This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output.
                Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call.
                This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
            starting-token: |-
                A token to specify where to start paginating.
                This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.

                For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

        Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following foundational data sources - VPC flow logs, Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, runtime activity belonging to container workloads, such as Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS (including Amazon Web Services Fargate), and Amazon EC2 instances. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, domains, or presence of malware on your Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances and container workloads serving malware, or mining bitcoin.

        GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments like EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce password strength.

        GuardDuty informs you about the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see the [*Amazon GuardDuty User Guide*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html) .
